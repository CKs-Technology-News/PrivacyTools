![Image credit: devrant + RMS himself](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1195970_gW3o6.jpg)

I will not add the following projects/software and I will not debate this. Don't make [him](https://stallman.org/) cry again 😢.

Please keep in mind that every software and service is at some point fixable and just because they are listed under this section does not mean they cannot be relisted once the mentioned product fixed provided criticism.


- [5G Bio Shield](https://5gbioshield.com/) – Cash gab to tool people with nonsense and claims + promises they cannot hold.
- [Aether](https://getaether.net/) – Peer-to-peer ephemeral public communities. The repository has not been updated with code since May 2020. The last version 0.15 has been released in November 2020 and there is no mention of it in the repository.
- [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) – ACLU unlisted because they might support and defend [Nazis](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/onion_acludefends.html). There is one reference link in my guide but I reviewed it, so I only let this one link stand but I clearly say you should not support such ideology or support right-winged people.
- [AnyType](https://anytype.io/) – Closed source.
- [Apple’s “Share Focus” is an uncharacteristically disastrous invasion of privacy](https://old.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/r7e9pk/share_focus_is_an_uncharacteristically_disastrous/)
- [Arattai](https://www.arattai.in/) – Closed source.
- [Aurora OS](https://nokiamob.net/2021/11/16/aurora-os-is-based-on-sailfish-but-owned-by-omp/) – Aurora OS is based on Sailfish but owned by Russian Open Mobile Platform.
- [Big Blue Button](https://bigbluebutton.org) – A professional video conferencing tool focused on online teaching and presenting. As such, it provides special features like slide-sharing, private and group chat, emoji feedback, polls, breakout rooms and many more. Removed due to [privacy concerns](https://empri-devops.de/blog/2022/01/26/bbb-learning-dashboard/).
- [Bitcomet is adware](https://www.bitcomet.com/en/license)
- [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/) – Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers.

- [Brave Search](https://search.brave.com) – A privacy respecting search engine with its own index, which doesn't rely on search engines like Google/Bing. It uses Amazon Cloudfront as their CDN, meaning all traffic passes through Amazon servers.
- [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) – Peer-to-peer encrypted messaging and forums. You can find an unofficial list with forums [here](https://codeberg.org/PandaCoderPL/Briar-Forums). [Briar itself does not provide anonymity](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/-/wikis/FAQ#does-briar-provide-anonymity) – Allows encrypted messages over Tor, WiFi, or Bluetooth (threat model is a communications-hostile environment/government). Briar gets unlisted compared to other alternatives because you need to be invited by other strangers - or friends - to join groups which makes it hard for beginners to find new groups, so it overall makes things harder to use as daily messenger. You can also not inspect the invite links or preview rooms, you just need to blindly trust people giving you a link. The program itself is perfectly fine but I ONLY suggest using it if you are on a demonstration, for other purposes other systems are more sufficient.
- [Bridgefy](https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/08/bridgefy-the-app-promoted-for-mass-protests-is-a-privacy-disaster/)

- [Dot Browser](https://dothq.co) – The browser with privacy at heart. Based on Firefox with some additions, modifications. The reason it does not get listed is that there are rarely updates which is controversial enough when it comes to overall security, if you want to use it you basically need to install nightly builds.

The developer has [no clue how Kasperskys AV really works](https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210607) and such people dare to talk about security. All he does is to apply best practices into an OS, since there is no competition except CalyxOS this promise seems to be quickly fulfilled since there is no audit no one can disprove their promises.

They [reverted](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/issues/1252#issuecomment-1018625643) it but the trust is gone because they deleted and locked the [discussion](https://github.com/d2phap/ImageGlass/issues/1252), which is not how you deal with this.

[#fedpot](https://intel471.com/blog/otp-password-bots-telegram), see [here](https://www.heise.de/news/Telegram-Messengerdienst-will-mit-Bundesinnenministerium-kooperieren-6349050.html) + [snitches](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/legal/telegram-channel-admins-who-sold-fake-vaccine-cards-arrested/) to collect, steal and upload data to scam people. [Telegram uses a homegrown encryption protocol called MTProto](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end), which has been [proven insecure](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2017/project/19.pdfm) by multiple [studies](https://caislab.kaist.ac.kr/publication/paper_files/2017/SCIS17_JU.pdf). Also worth noting are this article from [Bloomberg (published March 2018)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/telegram-loses-bid-to-stop-russia-from-getting-encryption-keys) and this [article from CSO (published May 2018)](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3273344/what-is-telegram-and-is-it-secure.html). Both of mentioned articles describe weak sides of mtproto version 1, these days Telegram uses [mtproto version 2 as of late 2017](https://core.telegram.org/api/end-to-end), where as I see it the described issues were fixed. Today Telegram uses [56-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption and Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(software)#Architecture) new with padding. [Telegram now censoring channels in Germany for “violating local laws”](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/nach-gespraechen-mit-bundesregierung-telegram-sperrt-erstmals-kanaele-in-deutschland-wegen-lokalen-gesetzesverstoessen/). I unlisted Telegram because they [introduced later the ads feature](https://newsbeezer.com/egypteng/telegram-introduces-the-ad-platform-feature-to-share-channel-owners-profits-with-the-company/) and after criticism they [changed their mind](https://twitter.com/KevinRothrock/status/1457034977766481926) and the fact that groups chats are not encrypted. Telegram [cannot be listed as private IM](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Telegram-Chat-der-sichere-Datenschutz-Albtraum-eine-Analyse-und-ein-Kommentar-4965774.html).

I still list some [Ubuntu](https://github.com/butteff/Ubuntu-Telemetry-Free-Privacy-Secure) based modified projects which I reviewed.

    - [Wire for Android](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.wire/) – Wire offers highly secure communication – anywhere and anytime.
- VSCode nor the [Web Version](https://vscode.dev/), the Browser Version due to enabled [Telemetry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry) by default, same like the crash reporter, you need to disable it, restart the app or block it via ad-blocker.

- [Session - Private Messenger](https://getsession.org/) – Extreme focus on privacy based on [Blockchain technology](https://cointelegraph.com/news/homeland-security-to-use-blockchain-in-tracking-goods-people-globally). Session is a much more complicated protocol with way too many additions and differing specs for it to be able to interoperate with Signal at this point. Possible [#fedpot](https://nitter.net/WPalant/status/1281540005190672384) and a gulag for nazis and [alt-right scene](https://nitter.net/WPalant/status/1281578526932705281) in general. - **highly controversial**
- [Signal](https://signal.org/) – Claims to be extreme [focused on privacy](https://signal.org/bigbrother/santaclara/), combined with some extra features like voice calls. Strong encryption by design. [Why Signal don't add option to create an account without phone number?](https://freedom.press/training/blog/beyond-signal-phone-numbers/) – They claim to be working on a proper way to support this, [Signal itself relies on Azure, AWS & Co.](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/hd2z9p/where%5C_are%5C_signals%5C_servers%5C_physically%5C_located/), which creates multiple [problems](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/signal-could-get-kicked-out-of-amazon-web-services/). I still list it here because [metadata](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/apple-now-relies-on-google-cloud-platform-and-amazon-s3-for-icloud-data/) are encrypted and minimal. [Signal to add closed-source spam detection](https://www.signal.org/blog/keeping-spam-off-signal/).

## [Alt-right communities, they are by no means alternatives for anything](#alt-right-communities-they-are-by-no-means-alternatives-for-anything)

My guide got copied already dozen of times without any credit, re-published on alt-right platforms [such as 4Chan](https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/84302113). I do not allow anonymous and random troll accounts to use or link my guides without permission nor consent because I do not want that Nazis abuse my findings to harass, bully and dox others or to spread their propaganda. 4chan is the dirt the internet does not need, and this is not [even news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan).

I never gave my permission to link or copy parts of my guidance on such websites because my intention is to help honest people who mean well and not people who abuse my findings and stuff for their questionable purposes.


![Against nazis](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF2a5cPXIAQVSKy?format=jpg&name=medium)


Do not bother nor give those platforms any clicks or attention. Mostly [filled with alt-right people and extremists](https://www.splcenter.org/peril-guide-online-youth-radicalization/). Some of listed projects are down for good. I do not link the evidence but ~~Google~~ searching and checking who is behind those platforms clearly shows that they are mostly alt-right winged, often used by people who got banned on legitimate social media platforms.
