- [Afterplay](https://afterplay.io/) ‚Äì Play your retro games in a browser across all your devices.
- [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) ‚Äì ACLU unlisted because they might support and defend [Nazis](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/onion_acludefends.html). There is one reference link in my guide but I reviewed it, so I only let this one link stand but I clearly say you should not support such ideology or support right-winged people.

- [Big Blue Button](https://bigbluebutton.org) ‚Äì A professional video conferencing tool focused on online teaching and presenting. As such, it provides special features like slide-sharing, private and group chat, emoji feedback, polls, breakout rooms and many more. Removed due to [privacy concerns](https://empri-devops.de/blog/2022/01/26/bbb-learning-dashboard/).
- [Binance](https://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-crypto-russia-binance-idINL5N2WK24B) #fedpot

Briar gets unlisted compared to other alternatives because you need to be invited by other strangers - or friends - to join groups which makes it hard for beginners to find new groups, so it overall makes things harder to use as daily messenger. You can also not inspect the invite links or preview rooms, you just need to blindly trust people giving you a link. The program itself is perfectly fine but I ONLY suggest using it if you are on a demonstration, for other purposes other systems are more sufficient.

[CTemplar deletes free accounts that haven't logged in in 36 months](https://ctemplar.com/help/answer/inactive-account-policy).

Developer release so-called "free" apps and locks specific features behind "paid" or "pro" features instead of only accepting donations, because he exactly knows that no one would donate once he does that.

[FairEmail development continues with the changes to the Privacy Policy](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/app-5-0-fairemail-fully-featured-open-source-privacy-oriented-email-app.3824168/page-1107#post-86938021).

The developer has [no clue how Kasperskys AV really works](https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210607) and such people dare to talk about security. All he does is to apply best practices into an OS, since there is no competition except CalyxOS this promise seems to be quickly fulfilled since there is no audit no one can disprove their promises.

Group calls via VOIP have [no authentication](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/13074) currently, meaning that non room participants can also join the calls.

A list of official clients can be found [here](https://matrix.org/clients/). Profile pictures, reactions, and nicknames are not encrypted this among the fact that encryption is by default enabled for everything is the main reason why I do not list it.

Same reason as GrapheneOS, its scam to trick you buying something you can do on your own, just installed naked eOS or GSI and you be fine, besides that argument you usually depend on Google Phones while the irony is that you want to get rid of Google. SO these are half-measurements. Tweaking things is easier than ever in almost every OS these days and only takes a script you apply on boot.

## [Alt-right communities, they are by no means alternatives for anything](#alt-right-communities-they-are-by-no-means-alternatives-for-anything)

My guide got copied already dozen of times without any credit, re-published on alt-right platforms [such as 4Chan](https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/84302113). I do not allow anonymous and random troll accounts to use or link my guides without permission nor consent because I do not want that Nazis abuse my findings to harass, bully and doxing others or to spread their propaganda. 4chan is the dirt the internet does not need, and this is not [even news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan).

I never gave my permission to link or copy parts of my guidance on such websites because my intention is to help honest people who mean well and not people who abuse my findings and stuff for their questionable purposes.


![Against nazis](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FF2a5cPXIAQVSKy?format=jpg&name=medium)


Do not bother nor give those platforms any clicks or attention. Mostly [filled with alt-right people and extremists](https://www.splcenter.org/peril-guide-online-youth-radicalization/). Some of listed projects are down for good. I do not link the evidence but ~~Google~~ searching and checking who is behind those platforms clearly shows that they are mostly alt-right winged, often used by people who got banned on legitimate social media platforms.
