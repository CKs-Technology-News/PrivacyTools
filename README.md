## [Browsers - A general starter](#browsers-a-general-starter)

Please check the [Browser + WebView Comparison Table](https://divestos.org/index.php?page=browsers) before you use something. In general I do not list any clown forks who offers no or less benefits because you can do it yourself without depending on a third-party project (in most cases) or in other words the community doesn't really need two practically identical packages that accomplish the same thing. [iOS has limited Browser choice](https://css-tricks.com/ios-browser-choice/).

- 360 Secure Browser is [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360_Secure_Browser)

- [Google Chrome](https://notochrome.org/)
- [Inox archived](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), similar like Ungoogled it is nothing but a hobby project. You can tweak vanilla Firefox version yourself and get a learning effect without depending on yet another third-party fork. The claim the project leaders made that this is independent from Mozilla is pure nonsense, they use Firefox as upstream and there is no independent development aside from changing some configuration related stuff and other gimmicks. Independence is not, I fork xyz and do some changes on my own. Independence would be to actually work on the entire Browser yourself, which is not the case.
- [Maxthon](https://www.maxthon.com/), its closed source and its main goal seems to be features not privacy + not frequently updated.
- [Opera](https://old.reddit.com/r/operabrowser/comments/i4hxjl/opera_privacy_and_concerns/) (Norway/China / Opera (company), Otello Corporation, Golden Brick Capital/Qihoo 360) which [comes with extensions you cannot uninstall](https://forums.opera.com/topic/46587/amazon-promotion-extension).
- Samsung Internet (South Korea)

### [Browser Profile Backup Solutions](#browser-profile-backup-solutions)

You can manually backup your profile or use some tools. Keep in mind that script based solutions can quickly corrupt your profile because the Browser might not be fully closed when you run the script.

- [Hekasoft Backup & Restore](https://www.hekasoft.com/hekasoft-backup-restore/) – All-in-one Windows solution to manage your browser data and settings across various Browsers. - **controversial**
- [Simple Backup for Firefox](https://www.sordum.org/12298/simple-firefox-backup-v1-2/) – Small Windows Tool to quickly backup your Firefox Profile. - **controversial**


### [Desktop Browser](#desktop-browser)

Please keep in mind that projects like Ungoogled Chromium are hobby projects and cannot nor will ever compete against professional projects such as Brave Browser, simply because more manpower is involved in Brave's development. The only reason Ungoogled Browser is listed here is because some people do not like Brave Browser because they eg. do not use any crypto Wallet features (among other reasons).


Browsers are typically used as gateways to a lot of things and not only Browsing, because you can hear audio, play videos, use PWAs, edit code, flash ROMs with it among other things, the term Browser is also heavily aged and outdated, since the program is so heavily altered these days that it more acts like all-in-one tool. It should be noted that using an questionable web browser that is not actively developed or maintained only by a single developer or a small group can be dangerous. Sticking with a mainstream browsers like Chrome/Chromium, Brave, Firefox is better for various reasons.


- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) – Open Source, independent browser based on Chromium/Chrome.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) – Open Source, independent browser. It needs some [hardening](https://bearblog.dev/dashboard/posts/8952) to archive better privacy. If you want you can host your own [sync-server](https://github.com/mozilla-services/syncserver).
    - [Wolvic](https://wolvic.com/) – Firefox Reality (Firefox for VR) being [spun out](https://github.com/Igalia/wolvic) as “Wolvic”.

### [Browser Extensions you do NOT need](#browser-extensions-you-do-not-need)

Every custom extension and configuration you change makes your browser unique in its own way. See e.g. [amiunique](https://amiunique.org/).

You do not need them if you have above listed extensions/add-ons installed or in case you use an up-2-date hardened browser. Additional infos/comments are labeled next to the extensions/add-on.

- Catblock
- [ChromeGalvanizer](https://github.com/mandatoryprogrammer/ChromeGalvanizer) – Harden your browser against extension backdoors and exploits.
- [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) – Can be archived via uBO. ClearURLs includes some other useful features like eTag "blocking" but in hardened Browsers this is not needed or can be archived without the need to depend on third-party extensions.
- [Display sites quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOT_Services) – Questionable benefit because the database is often not up-2-date or does not exist for page x.
- [Emulate locally CDNs](https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes) – Questionable gain of privacy, no proof or evidence. Implemented solutions are often outdated compared to real CDNs wo often update their stuff multiple times a day.
- [Prevent WebRTC IP leak](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webrtc-leak-shield/bppamachkoflopbagkdoflbgfjflfnfl) – Above listed browsers do not leak WebRTC or can be manually configured as per needs.
- [Unblock websites with a browser VPN/proxy](https://browsec.com/) – Optional, better use Tor/VPN instead of proxies.
- Cloud Firewall
- Cookie AutoDelete
- DDG Privacy Essentials
- Disconnect
- [Don't touch my tabs! (rel=noopener)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dont-touch-my-tabs/) – [Fixed within Mozilla Firefox source code](https://mathiasbynens.github.io/rel-noopener/) and removed from AMO.
- Google search link fix (also Yandex).
- HTTPS Everywhere is [deprecated](https://lemmy.ml/post/82533).
- HTTPZ – Replaced with Auto HTTPS mode in almost every Browser.
- I don't care about cookies / minerBlock – Most of those lists can be adopted in uBlock via a filter-list subscription.
- Link Cleaner
- Privacy Badger - Privacy Badger sends the Global Privacy Control signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the Do Not Track signal to tell companies not to track you, which makes you more unique without any real benefit since DnT is optional. If you want similar add-on use [Adguards StealthMode](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/StealthMode). PB itself had also long time problems with [Google Analytics](https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/issues/574#issuecomment-510036366).
- [Privacy Possum](https://libredd.it/9lanyg) - I am absolute no fan of such extensions, the chance that you discover new trackers is low because filter-lists usually getting updated regularly and monitored by the community. Even if there are new trackers the community would quickly add this to uBlock filter-lists which makes the entire purpose of locally ad-blocking learning obsolete.
- Redirect AMP to HTML
- Skip Redirect
- TrackMeNot

## [DNS and filtering](#dns-and-filtering)

[NextDNS](https://help.nextdns.io/t/h7hps0b/nextdns-app-deleted-from-appstore) **will not** get listed, they make money by [limiting the DNS queries](https://help.nextdns.io/t/p8hmvaw/what-happens-after-300k-queries), their filter-list are integrated from GitHub based on other people work (and they do not donate to such projects). I absolute have no respect for this. Making money on behalf of other peoples work will not be tolerated on my list, they designed it to make money out of it not to help the community, the argumentation that you can use it free without buying for it (unless you hit the limit) does not change the fact that they steal other people filter-list (without asking if they even wanted to be listed). It would be different if they would fully open it up and accept donations, but that is not the case. BlahDNS/youtube-dl (as example) also do not limit stuff and then forcing you to pay for it to "unlock" additional stuff, it would be unthinkable.

There is also another reason, you cannot self-host it.

### [DNS Servers](#dns-servers)
>  Do not blindly apply into any third-party DNS server, there are variables to consider like latency, privacy & security as well as the region you are from. Since I am from the EU/Swiss I only can list a handful providers. Listing 3 alternatives for every country would be too much for my list.


Key factors about DNS-over-HTTPS short: DOH
- Most ISP supporting [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) among some other well-known security standards.
- If you are using a VPN you should use your VPN provider's DNS server to minimize parties of trust, use one and exactly the same DNS and do not mix multiple DNS servers and resolvers across the OS, router, software e.g. Browsers. If you are not using any VPN and there is no censorship you should use your ISPs DNS server.
- Under no circumstances should encrypted DNS be used to bypass censorship because violations may still be recorded and observers will still know what IP addresses your accessing.
- Encrypted DNS doesn't make you anonymous, which means in other words, there is no improvement as privacy only factor. In fact you can smuggle something in the encrypted stream which you do not notice without inspecting the packages, which the normal user never does.
- [Overview of some providers and their tech behind](https://wiki.ipfire.org/dns/public-servers).

Please keep in mind that some guides might be a bit older, however some still have meaning and you possible can learn from them in an historic context to see how certain stuff evolved, or stay the same. In general guidance are only as good as the author did the research on the given topic, which means that some things can be universally applied to specific threads and other guidance are specific to one or a few given examples.

We only unlist stuff that is entirely incorrect or even dangerous to follow because security practical constantly evolves in both ways, positive ways and negative ways, which means new attacks emerge and new counter measurements also getting released because of the new threats.

## [HTTPS](#https)

**This section is not finished.**

- HTTPS wrongly gets advertised as secure, which is not the case, there are bunch of scenarios in which HTTPS fails to protect the users. Self-hosting won't solve much because even self-hosted setup would have to talk to the outside world in the end.
- [Proxies like Squid](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS) can do HTTPS intercepting. Certificate transparency effectively solves this because certain browsers, currently only Safari and Chrome [require all new certificates be submitted to multiple certificate transparency lists](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/docs/certificate-transparency.md) - if it encounters a certificate that isn't, it’ll show a warning page before establishing the TLS session. This doesn’t stop interception at all, but the first time it happens that some huge website notices a certificate they didn’t authorize and/or should be blocked by their CAA records, it’ll be a large event with disastrous consequences for the CA, likely triggering immediate within under <48 hours removal from publicly trusted CA lists. This happened already, [see here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kazakhstan-government-is-intercepting-https-traffic-in-its-capital/).
- [Countries could ban HTTPS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-doh-dot-esni/).
- Tor network helps against many vulnerabilities HTTPS has. With Tor, every domain generates their own public/private key pair (which represents the domain itself) hence making it impractical for actors to break all of them (in fact, breaking even one of the 128-bit ed25519 keys would be a breakthrough in cryptography).

## [Intel Management Engine & AMD Platform Security Processor](#intel-management-engine--amd-platform-security-processor)

> me_cleaner does not disable ME altogether, it just removes some "suspicious" parts. Majority of code still remains there. Same with AMD PSP. You can't remove all of it as your CPU will not even boot. PSP disable is supposed to disable some additional parts.

- AMD boards starting with B550 ([?](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/boards-that-disable-amd-psp.3416341/)) contain a setting to [disable AMD PSP](https://sandrokeil.github.io/yubikey-full-disk-encryption-secure-boot-uefi/security/disable-amd-psp.html).
- There are some hacks for Intel, alias me_cleaner, see [here](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/me_cleaner-status). The Intel Management Engine ('IME' or 'ME') is an out-of-band co-processor integrated in all post-2006 Intel-CPU-based PCs. It has [full network and memory access](https://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html) and runs proprietary, signed, closed-source software at ring -3, independently of the BIOS, main CPU and platform operating system — a fact which many regard as an unacceptable security risk (particularly given that at least one remotely exploitable security hole has already been reported). For Linux check [this](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sakaki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide) or the [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MujjuTWpQJk).

[FBI document shows what data can be obtained from encrypted messaging apps](https://therecord.media/fbi-document-shows-what-data-can-be-obtained-from-encrypted-messaging-apps/), this is controversial but gives an solid overview.

Not so good in terms of privacy:
- Clubhouse, because [lawyers say you could get sued](https://businessradiox.com/podcast/one-minute-interviews/brian-inkster/).
- [Facebook](https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/news/2021/norwegian-data-protection-authority-choose-not-to-use-facebook/) Messenger

- Systems that rely on Intel SGX for private discovery e.g. used by Signal.
- Systems that rely on Servers to resolve username to public key e.g. used by Wickr.
- Systems that rely on Servers to trust with your own IP address e.g. Wickr, Telegram and Signal.
- Systems that rely on Servers used to authenticate other unknown users e.g. used in Telegram.


### [P2P based Messaging](#p2p-based-messaging)
No servers involved. Everything goes directly from one peer to the other peer. No point of failure or control. The features are reduced because of the lack of server, messaging can be slower.

Peer-to-peer communications reveal one's IP address to each other, so using a reliable VPN, proxy, or TOR is advised. Briar is an exception to this rule, as it uses either Bluetooth range or the local network it's connected to; else all traffic goes through TOR. Ones without servers are ideal, such as: Jami, Tox, Ricochet, Status, Scuttlebot and PSYC-2. Some are still in development and may be prone to bugs.

Keep these options in mind when communicating with your clique. Many of us belong to private groups on Telegram which are presumably free from moderator surveillance (or at least interference), but ultimately we should transition to a more durable platform that will be unable to censor our messages. Try a few out and see what works for you and your crew.

## [Operating Systems](#operating-systems)
### [Android](#android)
Try to avoid using Google Android or any Android that has been modified and tuned by any manufacturer such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, etc. Android is an Open Source project – AOSP – Android Open Source Project – and it has many versions that will respect the [user privacy](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) and data and won't share it with private servers from [manufacturers or service providers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/security-audit-raises-severe-warnings-on-chinese-smartphone-models/).

It is important to use always the latest OS - if possible - there are several reasons e.g. Android 10 disallows Apps in general from third-parties to access critical stuff like IMEI, SIM, Serial Number, MAC etc. There are some small exceptions but overall it means that Google adopts certain problems and tries to solve them in the next versions which makes the OS by default more secure compared to older and easier attackable Builds.


### [Android Stock OS alternatives](#android-stock-os-alternatives)

[Anarchy-Droid](https://anarchy-droid.com/) acts as an installation helper for LineageOS and other ROMs.


It should clearly noted that most if not all listed alternatives that are based on AOSP are typically done to cash-grab others via donations with marketing phrases and unproven promises and claims like, use our product it is more privacy friendly or security optimised. Everyone can harden an OS, this is not some secret magic.

AOSP is under heavy development by more developers and overall more people are involved and claiming that you as individual person or small group do it better without even trying to submit patches to the original AOSP in the first place is not only rude and disrespectful but also ethical questionable, assuming yo believe in ethics. Forks usually tend to add no actual benefit into something unless done by professionals as well as people with an actual reasonable business model and independence, however most of the listed project highly depend on AOSP.

People tend to smear AOSP based on what vendors afterwards integrating and doing with it, e.g. adding bloatware apps etc. however you can compile AOSP yourself without any bloatware nor depend on another third-party identity such as GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, etc.

Hardening the OS yourself would be less of an mainstream problem if those who claim, in the name or privacy and security would submit their patches in public trough and open database. This is usually not the case and such people tend to lure people instead of their own websites, pages to pretend they do the most work, which is not only incorrect but also ethical questionable because the AOSP cares a lot about privacy and security and are reasonable in merging possible pull requests, assuming the patch actually fixes some hole, leak etc.

The underlying point is that those providers usually feeding off others people work, modifying it and claim privacy and security that are hard to proof for average users because they are not skilled enough to audit it themselves and often those claims cannot be verified because it consumes lots of time, research and in the meantime AOSP could have already addressed it trough a new patch-level set or entirely new major OS build. The ethical dilemma in using alternatives is that you need trust another unknown identity with unproven claims, while they claim they need money in form of e.g. donation to pay professional people to do an audit, which is the perfect excuse to collect donations luring people into using your product(s). Or in other words, use our product and support us and we show you can trust us afterwards when we got enough money to pay someone for an audit.

For example the GrapheneOS developer needs money to pay professional people to do an audit, while he claims, unproven, that his OS is more secure than others based on applying only best practices, while you could do this for yourself, assuming the team would release all of the modified AOSP patches. In such cases you simply need to keep his word as truth, because most people have no time, skill or knowledge to inspect the source code. Just because there is source code available does not conduct security because we had examples like Heatbleed when the source was years available and no one actually inspected it, which ended up leading people for years vulnerable. Open source therefore is not a guarantee for trust and security. The security lies heavily on the fact that actual people need to inspect your code, code that is complicated and you need the skills, time and research to come to an conclusion if it can be exploited. Facts that the teams does not communicate in public, because open source is no wonder weapon regarding security and never will be.

In truth the developers want to make a living out of it to continuing his job which is the reason they depend on money trough e.g. donations. This is at no time nowhere directly communicated.

The logic falls apart the moment you put every aspect in consideration because AOSP is a larger target and used by much more people than GrapheneOS, so mathematically, without even real world examples the claim that is more secure and private cannot be correct. Applying best coding practices and hardening alone also do not necessarily mean that your OS is more secure, for example if you touch known cryptography the opposite can happen, you end up more vulnerable. I also doubt such individual people and small groups in general because if they would actually fight for the mass they would help the AOSP Team directly so that everyone can benefit and use their code which is inspected by a bigger audience and used by lots of more vendors and users and not trying to cash-grab others based on Googles security practices, which are not GraphenesOS research and experiences.

In other words, give me money in form of donations because I claim my products are more secure and privacy friendly because I applied best practices. I am not really a friend of such claims and this has a wide history of been abused, it usually takes a while until someone figures such things out because, as mentioned inspecting things + have the knowledge to come to the conclusion how hard or easily something can be exploited is a real job and requires various skills. Unpaid people usually do not do all of this or are not involved.


Another point is breakages, when you apply best practices you usually break the entire eco-system, apps will stop working, you can only install various apps because the author decided to only approve certain apps, see the practice applied by Pale Moon developers who only approve certain extensions, or other dependencies simply stop working and you need to entirely trust such developers with their workarounds, workarounds no one typically inspect, audit or use, which automatically limits the target factor. The less it is known and used the less, mathematically it is insecure, this is just statistics, other consideration that even if there are holes, that the not automatically easily be exploitable are not even mentioned in such scenarios.

The whole story [reminds me on the Telegram Crypto-Gram challenge](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html) - Cripple the AOSP with best practices so that nothing works and then claim security to sell the product. Here use my product because it is secure, there is no audit, I cripple and break all apps or sandbox it to pretend I know what I am doing....

Can you crack the logic....?

## [Social Networks and Platforms](#social-networks-and-platforms)

In general [social networks are fedpots](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/21/surveillance-social-media-police-microsoft-shadowdragon-kaseware/). It should be noted that alternative clients and font-ends will still share your IP among some other metadata with the service as they make direct requests too, this means the Instance owner still can gather several data from you.

### [IRC](#irc)

You can combine Matrix with IRC via [bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/). Keep in mind that lots of IRC Servers might blocking Tor connections to prevent abuse. [IRCv3 server software feature support table](https://ircv3.net/software/servers), common [privacy and security issues with IRC are explained here](https://www.irchelp.org/security/privacy.html).


The main reason IRC or XMPP is listed and Matrix is not
- IRC and XMPP exist much longer and are proven to be effective. Depending on the protocol and client-side implementation of specific things, they are considerable secure and private enough.
- IRC and XMPP are more or less easier to fix without breaking something or causing tremendous preoccupations that influence privacy and or security in an negative way.
- Matrix gets wrongly advertised as all-in-one solution and super secure and whatnot, this is absolute not the case. It has many many weaknesses, leaks and some things are not encrypted at all.
- Matrix lacks fundamental moderation tools for admins which makes it hard to control your server as well as room compared to IRC, XMPP etc. Moderation bots for Matrix, as time of writing this do not exists for the wide mass.
- There are plans for IRCv3 and XMPPv3 that might solve mentioned issues.
- There exist better networks to Matrix for specific needs, which I listed below such as Mastodon which are for most people enough, depends of course on what you want, micro-blogging, chatting etc.
- Matrix gets money directly from the [government](https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/) which I do not like, nor do I see the need for such influence. The same could have been accomplished via eg donations.
- It is unclear if Matrix will include a crypto system like Signal or not. Rumors say they might introduce some sort of coin or NFT based system or overlay based system.

- [Openfire](https://github.com/Igniterealtime/Openfire) – An XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
- [OTR.me](https://otr.im/chat.html)


### [Jabber Clients](#jabber-clients)

Most clients highly depend on specific XEPs, those are [basically extensions](https://www.prosody.im/doc/xeplist). An example is that without [XEP-0198](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) you will be losing offline messages if your connection is unreliable.


### [About OMEMO](#about-omemo)

[Are we OMEMO yet?](https://omemo.top/) – This list displays the progress of OMEMO integration in various XMPP clients. Same like IRC, [XMPP has his own issues](https://blog.samwhited.com/2019/02/whats-wrong-with-xmpp/).


OMEMO alias [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) relies on XMPP PEP for publishing key information, so it will require changes to run over other protocols.


However, same like any other piece of code it can be complex, [OMEMO](https://codeberg.org/vanitasvitae/Smack/src/branch/filetransferTypos/documentation/extensions/omemo.md) is pretty large and [has some flaws](https://monal.im/blog/omemo-is-broken-in-general-across-the-ecosystem/) and [integration problems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20182674). Another problem with OMEMO is that it depends on [libsignal-protocol.js](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-javascript) that is developed by [Open Whisper Systems](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-protocol-c) and possible prevents you from using it due to the license it uses and [compatibility issues to other projects](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/omemo-issues-with-various-clients/85912). [OMEMOs audit is basically devastating](https://conversations.im/omemo/audit.pdf) and allows MITM attacks.


So in a nutshell:
- OMEMO is on paper better than OTR, but has [severe some flaws too](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16285135) and is far from easily integrated. It depends on several things like license, used framework etc.
- Clients that often support OMEMO normally do not support Audio/Video for various reasons and problems.
- OMEMO is a step in the right direction but it needs more work.


That said pretty much every listed client here is far from ideal and I list them for individual reasons. Please review them and check what you need, if Audio and Video is a factor than e.g. Conversations is not yours, in that case Dino might be a better choice.

### [Reddit](#reddit)

Try to [avoid using Reddit](https://themarkup.org/news/2021/12/16/the-shadows-of-removed-posts-are-hiding-in-plain-sight-on-reddit) or at least avoid their official clients because there are plenty of trackers and ad-systems integrated. Reddit itself shares a lot unnecessary user data with their servers and partners. If you want to use it anyway I highly recommend you to use `old.reddit.com` or `i.reddit.com` URLs instead because it renders faster and is more privacy respecting than the new design.

### [YouTube](#youtube)

Don't use YouTube (or their official client). YouTube is very privacy invasive, it generates a very accurate profile based on your interests. Also it is a [radicalization tool](https://www.pcmag.com/news/does-youtubes-algorithm-lead-to-radicalization) which shows [biased content to users](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) in order to get more engagement and to get them to watch more and more content creating an [addiction](https://medium.com/dataseries/how-youtube-is-addictive-259d5c575883). It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a lot of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

### [Social Media Wiping](#social-media-wiping)

Instead I suggest to use alternative accounts, one for questions, one for work etc.


The overall best strategy is that you post only useful or helpful stuff on platforms which does not expose or compromise you, this way you do not need to wipe something afterwards and you help others.

## [Threat Monitoring](#threat-monitoring)

## [Tor Network](#tor-network)

**This section is not finished.**

- [Tor is not perfect](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7gd9b/facebook-helped-fbi-hack-child-predator-buster-hernandez) same like any other protocol it has weaknesses but depending on how you count far less than most other known protocols. This argument makes it worth alone to suggest using the tor network.
- JavaScript among some other old and outdated web-standard are among the highest threat to the tor network, this is not really a tor network issue because tor simply need to fallback to older standards to not entirely breaking the web as we know it.
- Tor does not encrypted inbound traffic, for this you would need I2P. You can use I2P together with Tor but it is more configuration trouble.
- Content is encrypted between client and nodes but not from exit relay to server. The anonymity relies on servers, the more servers the more anonymous the user is because he can easily hide in the mass. However, if someone compromise [hundreds of Tor Relays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvBAaUPzvBQ) the entire privacy aspect will be lowered or even compromised.
- HTTPS redirects can be blocked so Tor isn't a fail-safe alternative.
- Using a browser add-on that rewrites the URL request before it's sends a GET request is paramount to security. If relying on the initial request to redirect after the fact the resulting method could be overwritten by an exploited endpoint.
- Combining Invisible Internet Project alias I2P and Freenet for file-sharing could help solve some, but not all problems.
- The biggest problem with Tor is that it is not really usable in the real world due to how it works, most websites simply ban Tor traffic, or you get spammed with CAPTCHAs. Some ISPs directly flag you if you use the tor network which means you are classified as possible threat which makes you more unique among - normal - users.


Major problems while using Tor
- Constantly reCaptcha requests, which you need to solve. Almost every captcha system is at some point privacy invasive by design.
- Lots of providers throttle your internet connection once they detect, unusual, traffic. This can make you more likely a target because you stick out like a needle from the mass.
- Security pages, like banking often entirely block connections coming from Tor users which makes it impossible to use Tor on eg. your banking page. Trying to workaround this often results in more fingerprinting and restrictions.

## [VPN](#vpn)

PrivacyTools, now called PrivacyGuides spreads [misinformation regarding Five Eyes, 9 Eyes, and 14 Eyes](https://www.privacyguides.org/providers/vpn/#criteria) [jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction). Over the years PTIO/PGIO updated their original statement a lot and it looks better today but it is still overall wrong because people tend to believe that they are more secure and private if they use services, tools etc. that are not connected to such countries, programs or cooperation's - in the real world, this is not the case. There is no evidence to backup such claim, it is more likely the opposite, there is evidence that this does not change anything at all as I will explain below in detail with one specific example, there are others but it would be too complex here to go into every single detail because most people are already overwhelmed with this one given example.


Example that criminals in the real-world would use

Assuming you choose a provider outside any of those alliances and countries and their real servers are not located in such countries or have any other [partnership](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-surveillance-intelligence-services-vol-2_en.pdf), there is still no guarantee that the provider is not forced by other laws and cooperation to hand over your data anyway. There are alliances which are not directly bound by data protection laws only, lets say you plan to kill someone and you choose to use provider X as assurance that your secret is safe, you really think they not going down on you? With they I mean e.g. [Interpol](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/interpol-arrests-1-000-suspects-seizes-27m-in-crackdown-on-cybercrime), if they not already obtained evidence that you used provider X to plan or spread your plans to kill someone, such thinking is more than naive. Interpol will rain down on you, you can count on that and every country that is not working with one of those alliances works together with eg. [Europol](https://twitter.com/Europol/status/1465277646250680321), Interpol and others. There is no country that does not work together with some organization across borders to hunt down criminals. There is no actual evidence that someone got away while planing and executing murder on the internet, it often took long but at the end everyone made a mistake and the feds got them, see [Silkroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)), even with Tor and other protection mechanism there is always something, human error or other variables. Thinking you are 100% protected and get away with it is [naive](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/gutachten-veroeffentlicht-wie-us-geheimdienste-daten-aus-der-eu-abgreifen-koennten/), it takes time to hunt criminals down, yes but there was no case ever that survived for long, the moment the feds are getting involved you can basically say goodbye, see cases like [Cyberbunker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBunker), Silk [etc](https://www.caymancompass.com/crime-and-courts/).

[People can also secretly do illegal surveillance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/this-swiss-tech-exec-is-said-to-have-operated-a-secret-surveillance-operation) and sell such data or give it away for free. Jurisdiction wise it does not hold but if illegal obtained contain hard evidence for e.g. murder, they [will anyway start an investigation](https://gilleslaw.com/illegally-obtained-evidence/) even if they cannot directly prosecute you based on the illegal obtained data. This happened several times, one of the most known example for this is the [Panama Hack](https://www.clearyenforcementwatch.com/2019/01/u-s-criminal-prosecution-based-on-panama-papers-hack-raises-novel-legal-issues/).

--------------------------

If you do [illegal stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_jurisdiction#:~:text=Criminal%20jurisdiction%20is%20a%20term,the%20commission%20of%20a%20crime.&text=People%20must%20be%20tried%20in%20the%20same%20state%20the%20crime%20is%20committed). that is forbidden in every country alias transborder crimes the [jurisdiction argument alone does not matter](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419235515/https://blog.privacytools.io/relisting-startpage/) and even if, they [will bypass](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/01/using-foreign-nationals-to-bypass-us-surveillance-restrictions.html) it because if the judge gets evidence that there is something that you are involved in, they can rule and [force everyone to hand over all data or shut it down](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-vpn-service-used-by-ransomware-gangs-was-just-taken-down-by-police/). This is okay because the Internet shall no place to help, support or advertise criminal activities.

--------------------------

Some more details
- There are multiple types of [jurisdiction in a criminal case](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/jurisdiction-criminal-case.html).
- PrivacyTools or short PTIO, wrongly spread and assume jurisdiction matters when it comes to VPNs or Software in general, yet they fail to list one single precedent case, because there is none. Their believes is based on Snowdens leaked picture - among some other stuff - that got spread around the Internet and misinterpreted - from people that are not experts, aka news media - based on the assumption that Google and Big Tech works directly together with the Govt. to hand over all your data. This is not the case, the Govt. needs to request such cases and explain in detail to court why they want to have such data. In such a case they already gathered enough evidence that you are a criminal. Criminal laws overrule any privacy laws. Google etc. also do not get paid to hand over any data, so why should they if it is huge effort without getting anything in return. It is the opposite, Google wants to collect data because they make the money with it and there is no evidence that they sell obtained data directly to the NSA in order to make money based on your private data. Big Tech wants to collect data to build their own algorithm, tools which they can sell, they have absolute zero interest in selling stuff which benefits themselves to feed their programs, algorithm and to gain intelligence to stay on top of the competition. If you sell and share all your data to the competition you can close your business.
- Encryption is what matters more than jurisdiction because if they - for example ISP - cannot use such data to connect the dots to you because missing metadata, no one can build a case against you and the court will automatically reject any attempt to prosecute you. You only get prosecuted if there is enough evidence which can include metadata. The Intelligent Agencies around the world request data if they have reasons to believe that your service is involved into illegal activities, this is absolute not bound to the UK, USA etc. only, such data request are common. The only difference is mass surveillance vs individual requests. However the [original surveillance program got now stopped](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/nsa-surveillance) and [declared as illegal](https://www.dw.com/en/nsa-snowden/a-54797779). There are no new programs and you cannot just secretly establish new programs without money and funds for such surveillance. However, there are other projects and programs started or still [running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects), keep in mind that the list is incomplete and some countries might never - in public - disclosed their programs.
- There is no case in which jurisdiction makes a difference. If Swiss, that have the strongest privacy laws in the world have evidence enough that you are a indeed a criminal they still can order a Swiss ISP to hand over data, there are dozens of such cases across every country, no matter if Five eyes or not. She [here](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2018/04/swedish-patents-and-market-court-of.html), [here](https://torrentfreak.com/isp-ordered-to-hand-over-pirates-details-after-cracked-software-phoned-home-200629/) or read the [book](https://books.google.de/books?id=KNUy5a3ssykC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=swiss+isp+ordered+to+hand+over+data&ots=4G6pSB40vm&sig=ACfU3U1blBLXNWcizc3exBqSQbl4NuYfEA&hl=en).
- Jurisdiction can makes things harder but [not impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement#Controversy) in case we are referring to - hand over data - to X. There is no evidence that none members cannot simply request data too. Leaks only showed included members but never ever mentioned what if someone outside those countries try to request data, it is called [special relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship).
- [Collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) is not bound to individual partners or countries.
- Jurisdiction only matters in case there are sufficient information, leaks, metadata available against you or someone else to build a case. The location does not matter if data are sufficient encrypted. The assumption to lower the risk by choosing a country outside the [UKUSA Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement#:~:text=The%20%22Fourteen%20Eyes%22%2C%20consisting,signals%20intelligence%20among%20its%20members) is not proven to make anything more secure, because - depending on the HOPS - the traffic still goes over at least one or more Internet [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) from one of those countries anyway which then can [collect the traffic and decrypt it later](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001/). Once you gathered such data you can build surveillance strategies, the jurisdiction here simply can be bypassed, illegal obtained or not because they - govt, isp - etc. already got plausible cause to wiretap you. Which happened a lot already in lots of FBI cases. PTIO fails to provide any evidence for their claim how jurisdiction loopholes would change something in your favors.
- None of the PTIO maintainers are experts in internet law, cryptography, security nor are they involved into such cases before or after the Snowden leaks. They basically claim a lot without showing actual evidence. They wrongly interpret pictures from leaks, how they see it, and not based on what is really happening in the real world. This is why no one can take this organization serious. It is a collective of red-pilled people and that is all, in the real world we provide evidence, ask lawyers and check actual laws, doing the needed research and just claiming X without evidence is unprofessional.
- Countries like USA or powerful organisations like NSA do not gave any shit about legal or illegal, so what you think other countries will do, well similar things, it depends who is in charge and who gives the money for such surveillance programs, some countries have simply less budget for surveillance. But that does not mean there is none.
- [Redirecting internet traffic](https://www.securityweek.com/russian-telco-hijacked-internet-traffic-major-networks-accident-or-malicious-action#:~:text=Home%20%E2%80%BA%20Network%20Security-,Russian%20Telco%20Hijacked%20Internet%20Traffic,Networks%20%2D%20Accident%20or%20Malicious%20Action%3F&text=A%20huge%20BGP%20hijack%20by,Russian%20servers%20on%20April%201) is possible and it happened multiple times, this includes every traffic.


Nutshell
- Encryption is what is more important because even if someone is, for whatever reasons, forced to hand over data and the service or programs you used, uses a strong encryption, no one will be able to open and access your private data stream or files. [Zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) is what ultimate counts in such examples cases, nothing else.
- People tend to want full anonymity and not a VPN. A VPN also leaves traces and metadata behind. It is just harder to backtrack.
- [Coffee shops and airports are not how you get hacked](https://twitter.com/boblord/status/1489632248382967810), there are rare exceptions but this is an generalization VPN providers use or abuse as selling argument. Assuming there is a breach, the shop owner or airport would fix it afterwards anyway to prevent that this will ever happen again because it brings negative light on the IT admins behind. Coming to the false conclusion that every public network is automatically be compromised is a claim without any evidence. The overall web-security evolved in the past years and Browsers, OS getting better and usually respond to threats. The underlying problems are usually at user end or because of bad security practices from the people who setup the networks in the first place.
- [PTIO often spread misinformation](https://lemmy.ml/post/31433) because they are based.

### [About WireGuard](#about-wireguard)

[WireGuard](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/is-wireguard-the-future-of-vpn-protocols-safety-update/). has [many](https://lwn.net/Articles/802376/), [many](https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/wireguard/) [issues](https://tailscale.com/blog/why-not-why-not-wireguard/), as explained [here](https://blog.ipfire.org/post/why-not-wireguard) and [here](https://protonvpn.com/blog/openvpn-vs-wireguard/). Because of [several flaws](https://www.servethehome.com/pfsense-and-freebsd-pull-back-on-kernel-wireguard-support/) WireGuard does not get my approval at this point, their [design goals](https://lore.kernel.org/wireguard/CADdae-ifP9GN=oaKz_SnzDK+uAx7MFHaSkFPymBRgC9t07hY8g@mail.gmail.com/T/) also do not match with what most people, in the real world really want.


- The official app does not have a kill-switch option within the GUI, there is a cmd-line parameter for Linux user but it is overall hard to work with it and there is no guarantee it really works unless you debug it via console or third-party tools to ensure nothing drops.
- The official app has absolute no indicators if you are still connected to the VPN server or not, there is no warning or info indicator when you drop the connection once you minimized the app. You only see connected or disconnected from within the app.
- [WireGuard](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/17380) does [not](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/21692) work with [LLv6](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/17380#issuecomment-1008323004) by design, see [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.1).
- VPN provider like eg. ProtonVPN re-wrote lots of the server and client parts, adopted and fixed flaws in their own client app which makes it not really comparable with the original WireGuard app or other VPN provider apps who did similar stuff to fix flaws.
- [Cryptographic proof is not absolute](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02100345).
- WireGuard doesn't dynamically assign IP addresses which means every time you use it, you get the same, easy-to-track static IP address. This overall means WireGuard must log and store your IP address and timestamps. Both OpenVPN and IKEv2 avoid these security concerns by dynamically assigning IP addresses.
- Most RouterOS do not support WireGuard - yet. There are only externals like OpenWRT that support it directly, most users do not installing third-party firmware on their device because it requires technical skill, time and effort - assuming your IoT device is even supported and fully compatible.

Overall except the smaller codebase, less battery draining among the less CPU power you need there is absolute no benefit over OpenVPN.

The main reason why some VPN provider adding it is not security, or privacy, it is in most cases [speed and efficiency](https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/08/wireguard_linux/) compared to IPSec and OpenVPN.

## [Versions Control](#versions-control)

Remember that just because you self-host doesn't mean you can ignore DMCA take-down requests (DMCA itself is obviously an US law, but many [Western](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029) [countries have similar laws](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_id=16)). You can choose to ignore such DMCA requests if they decide to send one to your self-hosted website, but not honoring it means you think you're not infringing on their copyright and are willing to go to court over it. If they don't want to go this far, or you try to not include contact info, they'll probably first send a DMCA to your web host/registrar who will suspend your hosting/website unless you counter-notice, which still means you've got to be ready to fight a lawsuit. Note that Cloudflare forwards DMCA requests to your web host company, so you can't hide behind CF.
