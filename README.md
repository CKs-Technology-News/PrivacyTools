## [This is not an "awesome", "ultimate" or "perfect" list](#this-is-not-an-awesome-ultimate-or-perfect-list)

This is my own collection I gathered over the years, written down into one single file which anyone can freely access. I do claim that the listed tools are good enough alternatives to e.g. Google, Microsoft etc. products. I believe it's an important piece of democracy that we have the right to be anonymous and free of tracking in our personal life, this is why I've created this list in the first place. I do [not believe](https://numair.medium.com/competitive-losers-e4e8cf06bda9) in any [competition](https://rugpullindex.com/blog#IsCompetitionForLosers), which means listed tools/products are not in any competition to each one another and I do not get paid nor sponsored showing them on my page.

## [Do not drag me into so-called "privacy communities"](#do-not-drag-me-into-so-called-privacy-communities)

I do not want to have anything to do with [PrivacyGuides](https://lemmy.ml/post/31433), [PrismBreak](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6010803) or any other "privacy clown community". Please do not link me / my guides into such communities. The reason is simply, I want to stay unbiased and objective. I do not advertise tools to gain money/reputation or to get any benefit out of it. I fully stand behind listed products because I tested or reviewed them and can suggest them without hesitation.


## [About evidence aka links as so-called proof](#about-evidence-aka-links-as-so-called-proof)

I, among others depend on evidence - findings and sources - from third-parties, unless we do and inspect it ourselves, but are external links to claims + [statements which you can not verify yourself](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9HoG56Y6KuopSzdn/law-of-no-evidence) real evidence? **NO**.

- GitHub itself has a bug, which you can [abuse](https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/Delit), they [refuse to fix](https://bounty.github.com/ineligible.html#impersonating_a_user_through_git_email_address) it because it is, according to them not critical and part of another feature.
- Sources are often protected, or obfuscated, renamed to protect individual people. Some reporters do not even bother to link to a specific source at all.
- Screenshots can be faked easily, same like text and timestamps. Everyone can access eg. Adobe Photoshop, Gimp, online tools etc. You do not have to be skilled to do such things. [‘Evidence’ means and includes All documents including electronic records produced for the inspection of the Court](https://indianlegalsolution.com/can-screenshots-be-submitted-as-evidence-or-not/).
- You cannot, in most cases contact FBI etc. to verify statements because they do not answer you directly even if you are an actual reporter, getting in touch takes lots of time and effort. Writing an eMail to feds, Google and Co. only results that you get an automated Bot answer back.
- External links, content and claims by others are by no means ultimate proof, but it gives someone a glimpse that there is something wrong or revealed.
- Verification of some statements are impossible to reproduce unless you have access, or are you skilled enough eg. doing an audit yourself or hire someone professional. Most people have no time, and no skill to audit a program or review something on a professional level because it consumes time, you need coding skills and the understanding how to spot certain patterns which you only obtain if you deeply involved into such topics. Professional people usually taking money for the time they do to audit software.
- Things can change in the meantime or the media forgot some stuff to include in their reports, it happens all the time. Newspapers and news have these days almost no trust.
- Some news, articles spread, on purpose misinformation, there is political motivation, there are feds that give reporters on purpose wrong information or lead parts out and so on.
- There is bias, there always is. This can be a problem for credibility and objectiveness.
- You can misinterpret something based on your own bias, based on someones reputation eg. author of the article or because you simply do not understand the source because it is simply beyond your horizon. The Snowden leaks often got misinterpreted by people that are no network or cloud experts, deliberately speculating something more into given pictures or slides without asking any necessary questions or doing some research.
- Claims, even from reputable sources, e.g. that [Monero is cracked](https://cryptopotato.com/monero-xmr-sybil-attack-not-broken/) is spread like wild-fire and re-shared dozen of times, the [reality looks entirely different](https://www.globalcryptopress.com/2020/07/leaked-fbi-docs-show-just-how-easily.html?=online). In fact such news often help to make such networks even more secure, because [people want money](https://securityboulevard.com/2020/09/can-you-crack-monero-irs-offers-625000-bounty-for-anyone-who-can-break-privacy-of-cryptocurrency/).


This is a huge dilemma because the user - you - simply need to trust that the reporter, author, blogger, dev etc. or a normal user who wrote the article with such findings really shows the truth, without actually knowing his motivation or the real person behind it. If you accuse someone you need to [provide the burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)), if it comes out that you wrongfully accuse someone [charges against you can be made](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/damages-defamation-case.html), eg. to prevent and suppress [slander](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/defamation-slander-libel).

I try to workaround this issue by linking to articles and sources that can be verified or recreated by you, or that makes the most logical sense. I am absolute not responsible for third-party links nor do I claim that every given article is the entire truth, in fact I say that the sources should be questioned and inspected no matter if it is from the FBI, Washington Post or any other source.


## [Why is MacOS, iOS and Windows listed](#why-is-macos-ios-and-windows-listed)

I plan to split this list once I collected enough apps for those closed source platforms. Until then I keep them until I know how I am going to split the list exactly.


## [Something incorrect, outdated or you want to contribute?](#something-incorrect-outdated-or-you-want-to-contribute)

In case you have some questions, you can ask them directly on our official [Matrix Server](https://matrix.to/#/#cktn-chat:matrix.org). In case you want RSS based news/feeds for mostly FOSS tools only, you can follow my guild on [Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/ckstechnologynews) if you want.

--------------------------------------------------

## [What does not belong on my list](#what-does-not-belong-on-my-list)
1. **Fedpots** – Potential honeypots and/or services/tools behind feds/police. If it is clear that the network, service or app is directly involved into such activity it will get unlisted.
2. **Criminal stuff** – If the creator/inventor, CEO, whatever, was once involved into criminal activities, their products getting unlisted. No matter how good their products are. I also see software with [dark patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) as criminal e.g. KC Softwares SUMo.
3. **Controversial tools or services** which cannot be fully verified or reviewed because of e.g. lack of transparency or because they are propriety, see 5.
4. **Cracked software/services**, if I see that a service cannot handle leaks or there are mass uploads with cracked accounts on e.g. Telegram it is automatically a no-go, no matter how good the service/tool is. I also do not list illegal tools/services.
5. **Closed source software** – Unless verified, tested and proven "worthy" – *Can you lift Mjölnir* to be worthy? Closed source must be labeled as such and should be the exceptions on my list. Trackers in software or websites of any kind are not allowed unless approved.
6. I do not give much 💩 about **ethical aspects in software** or for that matter in [ethics in general](https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/) unless we hit the criminal section and then there is [morality aspect](https://aeon.co/essays/five-reasons-why-moral-philosophy-is-distracting-and-harmful). You can abuse almost every legitimate software and do shady stuff with it, repack it with malware etc. I am not the one who can control every aspect nor the people who plan to do such malicious intends things.
7. The **persons behind software/service have their own life** and I do not care/judge them if they come from Mars or have two *waifus*, as long they play by our current laws. Everyone can pretend to be a good guy, it is not up to us to be judge and executive in one person. However, if I see the interest is mainly to make only money out if it, I will most likely not list them unless there are absolute no other alternatives usable.
8. **Every (popular) software or service might leak at some point**, good software and developers are defined by how fast they handle/react such things and if they disclose everything in public or not. Trying to hide something is a no-go.
9. I am not a criminal and **my goal here is not to list tools for criminals** which they can use/abuse for shady stuff like doxing others and getting away with it. – I kneel before society laws even if I do not fully agree or like all of them, this is called living in a democracy and the reason more than one tool in the same category is listed, simply to give you a choice (if possible).
10. I am **not [red nor blue pilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill)**. – This means that I change my mind considerable *often* when I see it fits (software/services evolves so do attacks & leaks). Example: I currently use Brave Browser but if I see Browser X is better, then I switch it and do not aggressively try to get people on my side with made up arguments or try finding excuses in order get others following my "opinion". That being said, *fanboyism* is not welcome here. The things here are listed because they are reliable, secure and privacy-friendly, anonymity is just a "bonus".

Please keep in mind that there will always be leaks, software is never perfect and privacy/security is more a concept/idea which is defined by people with "high" standards/expectations.


## [Definition of the word "controversial" on my list](#definition-of-the-word-controversial-on-my-list)
- Closed source or OSS.
- Connections to AWS, Google, Azure even if encryption is strong enough.
- Contains [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge), there are some products listed with Google Fonts but in that case I made sure they can be self-hosted to eliminate the exposure of possible backtracking. Google collects some data, they say it is to improve the service - whatever that means.
- Ethical right is by no means a subject, most people mean moral anyway. However, if the status of the software and his involving into X are unclear then this also results automatically in a controversial tag. Besides criminal involvement this extends to harassment, doxing and behavior which is not tolerated by society terms.
- Possible outdated without a statement from maintainers or developers.
- Weak or broken encryption.

--------------------------------------------------

## [How does software or service X land on my list?](#how-does-software-or-service-x-land-on-my-list)
1. **FOSS** / closed source – Closed source automatically ranks lowest and should only be listed as exception if no alternative is usable/available.
2. **Maintained** – I will not add a software or services that are not actively maintained. Everything that does not got any updates within 1 year is considerable dead. This is rather a person preference than a real argument, because if something is perfect nothing needs to added, changed therefore commit activity is no real indicator that someone is working or not working on his program, it only indicates when the last commit was. I choose 1 year as overall measurement here because in the meantime other alternatives could have be created or the maintainer decided to work on more important things. However, the argument alone - is dead - is subjective term, which I aware off. In best case scenario there is an official statement or the repository is visible labeled as closed, archived or there are otherwise other tags that directly indicate the project status e.g. Readme.md files or other documents.
3. **Reviewed** / **evidence** / **audited** – An audit is only a snapshot review which does not mean that in the near future there could nothing go wrong, but it shows how transparent the software/developer is and what third-parties had to say about the product. It also can reveal how they handle possible revealed problems and how they communicate this into public.
4. **Usability** – The best software is useless if I or others cannot really use it. Listed products and solutions must be usable beyond any made-up criteria. There is no definition about what is usable so this is an subjective point.
5. **Criminal background check** – Or connections to advertising companies which also includes bias/interest checks to ensure that in the future nothing "bad" happens with product/service x. Software regarding criminal activities never gets listed.
6. **Malware/tracking check** – If it contains any sort of malware it will get reported. Tracking depends on how severe it is and if the included trackers/analytics are FOSS and explained or not e.g. Kiwi Browser.
7. **Self-host** – Software which can get self-hosted ranks automatically higher since you can then control every aspect of the software.
8. **Rumor check** – I personally give nothing about rumors from unknown sources, but there will be a background check regarding the software or service itself.
9. **Paid** – I am not against paid software in general because every developer needs to pay bills – like the rest of us – but I will do a check what payment system he uses to obtain donations/money, if I see that the developer uses none privacy-friendly services like PayPal I might not list the product at all, unless there are other friendlier options like e.g. Monero listed.
10. **It is my list and not yours** – I will have the last word what I list here because at the end of the day I vouch with my name for listed products.

--------------------------------------------------

## [Software Audits are no approval Certificate](#software-audits-are-no-approval-certificate)
Software audits are often overrated and play more a role for business reasons, eg. to provide your assurance company with plausible information in case something went wrong, data breach, hacks and so on. They usually do background checks like if things were known, and then cross-reference how the business cooperation actually handled it. The assurance company typical checks if audit concerns have been addressed or not, among bunch of other things that are unrelated to audits. An independent review of your code can help in such cases to show evidence that at that time everything was secure and private or that absolute no severe hole was discovered in the first place.


Software audits are in general no certificate or approval indicator on how good software overall is, rather it is a snapshot - at that time - from a third-party inspecting your source code. This is no absolute statement because the ones that inspected that piece of code only check things against known best practices as well as known security vulnerabilities as well as doing some leak checks, among lots of other things...

This does overall mean anything at all because you can address possible flaws afterwards even if something was discovered. The security relies here on how you actually respond to possible found flaws.

Also, not every flaw that exists gets directly exploited. Just because there were theoretically some issues revealed does not necessarily mean it was actively abused in the world. This argument goes vice-versa, just because some expert did not found a flaw, does not mean there is no way to attack the software or to exploit other weaknesses such as social engineering.

Assuming your product constantly evolves by adding new features and fixing known issues you code dramatically changes, theory you need to let your product audit after each major release or big change in the code. Since an independent audit is expensive this is simply impossible for normal developers to pay for. Usually developers trying to workaround possible flaws by reviewing each pull request as well as code changes they make themselves against certain security and privacy best practices, this is however not the same as an independent audit from a third-party.


**Note**

The myth that if you pay someone external to audit your code and then this company approves everything just because you paid money for it is absolute nonsense. The audit usually shows all findings, and explain usually how they did it and what they used in a document. Assuming your source code is accessible in public, people with enough knowledge could reproduce such findings and inspect the code.

Usually professionals always releasing a review paper to a public database, see below, to summarize the entire audit and to debunk or confirm if the piece of code, or the whole product has severe or small flaws.

The reputation damage here would be so big that no one seriously can risk that, because that would be a death sentence for the audit company, no one would do business with you again in the security scene. There is also no known case when professionals actually approved knowingly code that had flaws and went into public saying that everything was okay, faking the review, especially in open source were everyone can reproduce or review specific practices and samples this would not be possible, assuming the software source code is public visible and accessible.

--------------------------------------------------

## [Project Goals](#project-goals)
1. Listing 5 to 10 solid alternatives for every service/app/platform. Alphabetically sort content sections is low-priority.
2. All proprietary software should be removed (*there are only a handful listed currently*). Only FOSS products must be listed.
3. Remove/replace controversial stuff and find more evidence why they are controversial/removed.
4. Address [CDNs controversies](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/why-not-javascript-cdn) that [violate GDRP](https://twitter.com/FascinatingTech/status/1487342734906171393), that includes hosting aggregators like [Cloudflare](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28854425) among others. For example [Cloudflare logs user IP addresses for 24 hours and permanent logs data about the DNS requests that are sent to their custom resolver for eg Firefox indefinitely](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/cloudflare-resolver-firefox#what-information-does-the-cloudflare-resolver-for-firefox-collect). You can easily get some background information about an server with some online tools like [Serverhunter](https://www.serverhunter.com/).
5. Keep this list up-to-date and remove/tag or label outdated/important stuff.

## [DNS and filtering](#dns-and-filtering)
[NextDNS](https://help.nextdns.io/t/h7hps0b/nextdns-app-deleted-from-appstore) **will not** get listed, they make money by [limiting the DNS queries](https://help.nextdns.io/t/p8hmvaw/what-happens-after-300k-queries#:~:text=NextDNS%20can%20be%20used%20for,no%20filtering%2C%20no%20logging%20etc.), their filter-list are integrated from GitHub based on other people work (and they do not donate to such projects). I absolute have no respect for this. Making money on behalf of other peoples work will not be tolerated on my list, they designed it to make money out of it not to help the community, the argumentation that you can use it free without buying for it (unless you hit the limit) does not change the fact that they steal other people filter-list (without asking if they even wanted to be listed). It would be different if they would fully open it up and accept donations, but that is not the case. BlahDNS/youtube-dl (as example) also do not limit stuff and then forcing you to pay for it to "unlock" additional stuff, it would be unthinkable. It is beyond me why anyone should support NextDNS. Besides this argument, there is also another one, you cannot self-host it.

### [DNS Servers](#dns-servers)
>  Do not blindly apply into any third-party DNS server, there are variables to consider like latency, privacy & security as well as the region you are from. Since I am from the EU/Swiss I only can list a handful providers. Listing 3 alternatives for every country would be too much for my list.


Key factors about DNS-over-HTTPS short: DOH
- Most ISP supporting [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) among some other well-known security standards.
- If you are using a VPN you should use your VPN provider's DNS server to minimize parties of trust, use one and exactly the same DNS and do not mix multiple DNS servers and resolvers across the OS, router, software e.g. Browsers. If you are not using any VPN and there is no censorship you should use your ISPs DNS server.
- Under no circumstances should encrypted DNS be used to bypass censorship because violations may still be recorded and observers will still know what IP addresses your accessing.
- Encrypted DNS doesn't make you anonymous, which means in other words, there is no improvement as privacy only factor. In fact you can smuggle something in the encrypted stream which you do not notice without inspecting the packages, which the normal user never does.
- [Overview of some providers and their tech behind](https://wiki.ipfire.org/dns/public-servers).


Not so good in terms of privacy:
- Google DNS
- Cloudflare [ASN AS13335](https://host.io/asn/AS13335), see [here](https://git.disroot.org/dCF/deCloudflare/src/branch/master/readme/en.md) and [here](https://twitter.com/lxt/status/1462896850055352320)

Some notes regarding the Web3.

- [Web3 is not decentralized](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/web3-centralized), the Venture Capitalists and their Limited Partners do. It is [not about decentralization](https://invisibleup.com/articles/38/).
- It will never escape their [incentives](https://www.usenix.org/publications/loginonline/web3-fraud).
- It’s [ultimately a centralized entity with a different label](https://www.stephendiehl.com/blog/web3-bullshit.html).
- [Crypto push](https://medium.com/@rossstalker_5939/web3-is-not-decentralisation-its-a-ploy-to-put-crypto-bros-in-charge-c791752e2bb6) and a term uses in marketing.
- Internet itself has no versions numbers, it constantly evolves and changes + adopts new + removes obsolete protocols and tech.


## [Web Browser](#web-browser)

Please check the [Browser + WebView Comparison Table](https://divestos.org/index.php?page=browsers) before you use something. In general I do not list any clown forks who offers no or less benefits because you can do it yourself without depending on a third-party project (in most cases) or in other words the community doesn't really need two practically identical packages that accomplish the same thing. [iOS has limited Browser choice](https://css-tricks.com/ios-browser-choice/).

Not so good in terms of privacy:
- 360 Secure Browser ([Proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360_Secure_Browser))

- [Google Chrome](https://notochrome.org/)
- [Inox archived](https://github.com/gcarq/inox-patchset)
- [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), similar like Ungoogled it is nothing but a hobby project. You can tweak vanilla Firefox version yourself and get a learning effect without depending on yet another third-party fork. The claim the project leaders made that this is independent from Mozilla is pure nonsense, they use Firefox as upstream and there is no independent development aside from changing some configuration related stuff and other gimmicks. Independence is not, I fork xyz and do some changes on my own. Independence would be to actually work on the entire Browser yourself, which is not the case.
- [Maxthon](https://www.maxthon.com/), its closed source and its main goal seems to be features not privacy + not frequently updated.

### [Desktop Browser](#desktop-browser)

Please keep in mind that projects like Ungoogled Chromium are hobby projects and cannot nor will ever compete against professional projects such as Brave Browser, simply because more manpower is involved in Brave's development. The only reason Ungoogled Browser is listed here is because some people do not like Brave Browser because they eg. do not use any crypto Wallet features (among other reasons).


Browsers are typically used as gateways to a lot of things and not only Browsing, because you can hear audio, play videos, use PWAs, edit code, flash ROMs with it among other things, the term Browser is also heavily aged and outdated, since the program is so heavily altered these days that it more acts like all-in-one tool. It should be noted that using an questionable web browser that is not actively developed or maintained only by a single developer or a small group can be dangerous. Sticking with a mainstream browsers like Chrome/Chromium, Brave, Firefox is better for various reasons.

### [Web Browser Extensions you do NOT need](#web-browser-extensions-you-do-not-need)

Every custom extension and configuration you change makes your browser unique in its own way. See e.g. [amiunique](https://amiunique.org/).

You do not need them if you have above listed extensions/add-ons installed or in case you use an up-2-date hardened browser. Additional infos/comments are labeled next to the extensions/add-on.

- Catblock

- [ClearURLs](https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls) – Can be archived via uBO. ClearURLs includes some other useful features like eTag "blocking" but in hardened Browsers this is not needed or can be archived without the need to depend on third-party extensions.
- [Display sites quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOT_Services) – Questionable benefit because the database is often not up-2-date or does not exist for page x.

- Link Cleaner

## [Social Networks and Platforms](#social-networks-and-platforms)

In general [social networks are fedpots](https://theintercept.com/2021/09/21/surveillance-social-media-police-microsoft-shadowdragon-kaseware/). It should be noted that alternative clients and font-ends will still share your IP with the service as they make direct requests too, this means the Instance owner still can gather several data from you.

### [Instagram](#instagram)

Instagram is a [very privacy-invasive app](https://twitter.com/mame82/status/1464229264769884169) with biased results and feeds based on user profiles, it is also used as a manipulation tool and has a lot of censorship going against free speech. Lastly, it has an addictive and toxic UI design.

It never shows you [alternative opinions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08313.pdf) to your ideology/bias. YouTube censors a lot. YouTube collects a lot of your data: interests, free time, ideology, likes, dislikes, music taste, etc.

#### [Alternatives to Facebook](#alternatives-to-facebook)

I do not list Gab because it is somewhat connected and infiltrated by alt-right people. There is many proof to backup my statement. Alternatives like SlimSocial for Facebook only render the website in an app and ad-block or CSS block specific elements, Facebook still can be monitor everything e.g. see your IP which is the reason such apps are not listed here.

### [XMPP Jabber - Free Servers](#xmpp-jabber---free-servers)

- [Openfire](https://github.com/Igniterealtime/Openfire) – An XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License.
- [OTR.me](https://otr.im/chat.html)


### [Jabber Clients](#jabber-clients)

Most clients highly depend on specific XEPs, those are [basically extensions](https://www.prosody.im/doc/xeplist). An example is that without [XEP-0198](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html) you will be losing offline messages if your connection is unreliable.

### [About OMEMO](#about-omemo)

[Are we OMEMO yet?](https://omemo.top/) – This list displays the progress of OMEMO integration in various XMPP clients. Same like IRC, [XMPP has his own issues](https://blog.samwhited.com/2019/02/whats-wrong-with-xmpp/).


OMEMO alias [XEP-0384](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0384.html) relies on XMPP PEP for publishing key information, so it will require changes to run over other protocols.


However, same like any other piece of code it can be complex, [OMEMO](https://codeberg.org/vanitasvitae/Smack/src/branch/filetransferTypos/documentation/extensions/omemo.md) is pretty large and [has some flaws](https://monal.im/blog/omemo-is-broken-in-general-across-the-ecosystem/) and [integration problems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20182674). Another problem with OMEMO is that it depends on [libsignal-protocol.js](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-javascript) that is developed by [Open Whisper Systems](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/libsignal-protocol-c) and possible prevents you from using it due to the license it uses and [compatibility issues to other projects](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/omemo-issues-with-various-clients/85912). [OMEMOs audit is basically devastating](https://conversations.im/omemo/audit.pdf) and allows MITM attacks.


So in a nutshell:
- OMEMO is on paper better than OTR, but has [severe some flaws too](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16285135) and is far from easily integrated. It depends on several things like license, used framework etc.
- Clients that often support OMEMO normally do not support Audio/Video for various reasons and problems.
- OMEMO is a step in the right direction but it needs more work.


That said pretty much every listed client here is far from ideal and I list them for individual reasons. Please review them and check what you need, if Audio and Video is a factor than e.g. Conversations is not yours, in that case Dino might be a better choice.

### [Reddit](#reddit)

Try to [avoid using Reddit](https://themarkup.org/news/2021/12/16/the-shadows-of-removed-posts-are-hiding-in-plain-sight-on-reddit) or at least avoid their official clients because there are plenty of trackers and ad-systems integrated. Reddit itself shares a lot unnecessary user data with their servers and partners. If you want to use it anyway I highly recommend you to use `old.reddit.com` or `i.reddit.com` URLs instead because it renders faster and is more privacy respecting than the new design.

### [Social Media Wiping](#social-media-wiping)

Please consider NOT to wipe your posts on Reddit and other forum based platforms, the reason is simply, people search for answers and if you delete yours after you got a solution people might not be able to find useful stuff. Instead I suggest to use alternative accounts, one for questions, one for work etc.


The overall best strategy is that you post only useful or helpful stuff on platforms which does not expose or compromise you, this way you do not need to wipe something afterwards and you help others.

**Please check out [this website](https://www.securemessagingapps.com/) for comparisons**. Threema provides their own [chart](https://threema.ch/en/messenger-comparison). The most complete chart is [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/).


[FBI document shows what data can be obtained from encrypted messaging apps](https://therecord.media/fbi-document-shows-what-data-can-be-obtained-from-encrypted-messaging-apps/), this is controversial but gives an solid overview.

### [Instant Messaging Decentralized](#instant-messaging-decentralized)

No single point of control or failure. A decentralized network operated by different servers from different volunteers around the globe.

### [Instant Messaging Centralized](#instant-messaging-centralized)

Instant messaging guidance for beginners:
- [Matrix vs. XMPP - What are XMPP and Matrix and what makes them special?](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/matrix-vs-xmpp) + [comparison](https://blog.lewman.com/internet-messaging-versus-congested-network.html)
- [securechatguide.org](https://securechatguide.com) & [securemessagingapps.com](https://securemessagingapps.com)

## [IRC](#irc)

You can combine Matrix with IRC via [bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/). Keep in mind that lots of IRC Servers might blocking Tor connections to prevent abuse. [IRCv3 server software feature support table](https://ircv3.net/software/servers), common [privacy and security issues with IRC are explained here](https://www.irchelp.org/security/privacy.html).


The main reason IRC or XMPP is listed and Matrix is not
- IRC and XMPP exist much longer and are proven to be effective. Depending on the protocol and client-side implementation of specific things, they are considerable secure and private enough.
- IRC and XMPP are more or less easier to fix without breaking something or causing tremendous preoccupations that influence privacy and or security in an negative way.
- Matrix gets wrongly advertised as all-in-one solution and super secure and whatnot, this is absolute not the case. It has many many weaknesses, leaks and some things are not encrypted at all.
- Matrix lacks fundamental moderation tools for admins which makes it hard to control your server as well as room compared to IRC, XMPP etc. Moderation bots for Matrix, as time of writing this do not exists for the wide mass.
- There are plans for IRCv3 and XMPPv3 that might solve mentioned issues.
- There exist better networks to Matrix for specific needs, which I listed below such as Mastodon which are for most people enough, depends of course on what you want, micro-blogging, chatting etc.
- Matrix gets money directly from the [government](https://element.io/blog/element-raises-30m-as-matrix-explodes/) which I do not like, nor do I see the need for such influence. The same could have been accomplished via eg donations.
- It is unclear if Matrix will include a crypto system like Signal or not. Rumors say they might introduce some sort of coin system.

### [P2P](#p2p)
No servers involved. Everything goes directly from one peer to the other peer. No point of failure or control. The features are reduced because of the lack of server, messaging can be slower.

Peer-to-peer communications reveal one's IP address to each other, so using a reliable VPN, proxy, or TOR is advised. Briar is an exception to this rule, as it uses either Bluetooth range or the local network it's connected to; else all traffic goes through TOR. Ones without servers are ideal, such as: Jami, Tox, Ricochet, Status, Scuttlebot and PSYC-2. Some are still in development and may be prone to bugs.

Keep these options in mind when communicating with your clique. Many of us belong to private groups on Telegram which are presumably free from moderator surveillance (or at least interference), but ultimately we should transition to a more durable platform that will be unable to censor our messages. Try a few out and see what works for you and your crew.

## [Operating Systems](#operating-systems)
### [Android](#android)
Try to avoid using Google Android or any Android that has been modified and tuned by any manufacturer such as Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, etc. Android is an Open Source project – AOSP – Android Open Source Project – and it has many versions that will respect the [user privacy](https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/) and data and won't share it with private servers from [manufacturers or service providers](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/security-audit-raises-severe-warnings-on-chinese-smartphone-models/).

It is important to use always the latest OS - if possible - there are several reasons e.g. Android 10 disallows Apps in general from third-parties to access critical stuff like IMEI, SIM, Serial Number, MAC etc. There are some small exceptions but overall it means that Google adopts certain problems and tries to solve them in the next versions which makes the OS by default more secure compared to older and easier attackable Builds.


### [Android Stock OS alternatives](#android-stock-os-alternatives)

[Anarchy-Droid](https://anarchy-droid.com/) acts as an installation helper for LineageOS and other ROMs.


It should clearly noted that most if not all listed alternatives that are based on AOSP are typically done to cash-grab others via donations with marketing phrases and unproven promises and claims like, use our product it is more privacy friendly or security optimised. Everyone can harden an OS, this is not some secret magic.

AOSP is under heavy development by more developers and overall more people are involved and claiming that you as individual person or small group do it better without even trying to submit patches to the original AOSP in the first place is not only rude and disrespectful but also ethical questionable, assuming yo believe in ethics. Forks usually tend to add no actual benefit into something unless done by professionals as well as people with an actual reasonable business model and independence, however most of the listed project highly depend on AOSP.

People tend to smear AOSP based on what vendors afterwards integrating and doing with it, e.g. adding bloatware apps etc. however you can compile AOSP yourself without any bloatware nor depend on another third-party identity such as GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, etc.

Hardening the OS yourself would be less of an mainstream problem if those who claim, in the name or privacy and security would submit their patches in public trough and open database. This is usually not the case and such people tend to lure people instead of their own websites, pages to pretend they do the most work, which is not only incorrect but also ethical questionable because the AOSP cares a lot about privacy and security and are reasonable in merging possible pull requests, assuming the patch actually fixes some hole, leak etc.

The underlying point is that those providers usually feeding off others people work, modifying it and claim privacy and security that are hard to proof for average users because they are not skilled enough to audit it themselves and often those claims cannot be verified because it consumes lots of time, research and in the meantime AOSP could have already addressed it trough a new patch-level set or entirely new major OS build. The ethical dilemma in using alternatives is that you need trust another unknown identity with unproven claims, while they claim they need money in form of e.g. donation to pay professional people to do an audit, which is the perfect excuse to collect donations luring people into using your product(s). Or in other words, use our product and support us and we show you can trust us afterwards when we got enough money to pay someone for an audit.

For example the GrapheneOS developer needs money to pay professional people to do an audit, while he claims, unproven, that his OS is more secure than others based on applying only best practices, while you could do this for yourself, assuming the team would release all of the modified AOSP patches. In such cases you simply need to keep his word as truth, because most people have no time, skill or knowledge to inspect the source code. Just because there is source code available does not conduct security because we had examples like Heatbleed when the source was years available and no one actually inspected it, which ended up leading people for years vulnerable. Open source therefore is not a guarantee for trust and security. The security lies heavily on the fact that actual people need to inspect your code, code that is complicated and you need the skills, time and research to come to an conclusion if it can be exploited. Facts that the teams does not communicate in public, because open source is no wonder weapon regarding security and never will be.

In truth the developers want to make a living out of it to continuing his job which is the reason they depend on money trough e.g. donations. This is at no time nowhere directly communicated.

The logic falls apart the moment you put every aspect in consideration because AOSP is a larger target and used by much more people than GrapheneOS, so mathematically, without even real world examples the claim that is more secure and private cannot be correct. Applying best coding practices and hardening alone also do not necessarily mean that your OS is more secure, for example if you touch known cryptography the opposite can happen, you end up more vulnerable. I also doubt such individual people and small groups in general because if they would actually fight for the mass they would help the AOSP Team directly so that everyone can benefit and use their code which is inspected by a bigger audience and used by lots of more vendors and users and not trying to cash-grab others based on Googles security practices, which are not GraphenesOS research and experiences.

In other words, give me money in form of donations because I claim my products are more secure and privacy friendly because I applied best practices. I am not really a friend of such claims and this has a wide history of been abused, it usually takes a while until someone figures such things out because, as mentioned inspecting things + have the knowledge to come to the conclusion how hard or easily something can be exploited is a real job and requires various skills. Unpaid people usually do not do all of this or are not involved.


Another point is breakages, when you apply best practices you usually break the entire eco-system, apps will stop working, you can only install various apps because the author decided to only approve certain apps, see the practice applied by Pale Moon developers who only approve certain extensions, or other dependencies simply stop working and you need to entirely trust such developers with their workarounds, workarounds no one typically inspect, audit or use, which automatically limits the target factor. The less it is known and used the less, mathematically it is insecure, this is just statistics, other consideration that even if there are holes, that the not automatically easily be exploitable are not even mentioned in such scenarios.

The whole story [reminds me on the Telegram Crypto-Gram challenge](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/1998/1215.html) - Cripple the AOSP with best practices so that nothing works and then claim security to sell the product. Here use my product because it is secure, there is no audit, I cripple and break all apps or sandbox it to pretend I know what I am doing....

Can you crack the logic....?

## [Intel Management Engine & AMD Platform Security Processor](#intel-management-engine--amd-platform-security-processor)

> me_cleaner does not disable ME altogether, it just removes some "suspicious" parts. Majority of code still remains there. Same with AMD PSP. You can't remove all of it as your CPU will not even boot. PSP disable is supposed to disable some additional parts.

- AMD boards starting with B550 ([?](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/boards-that-disable-amd-psp.3416341/)) contain a setting to [disable AMD PSP](https://sandrokeil.github.io/yubikey-full-disk-encryption-secure-boot-uefi/security/disable-amd-psp.html).
- There are some hacks for Intel, alias me_cleaner, see [here](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/me_cleaner-status). The Intel Management Engine ('IME' or 'ME') is an out-of-band co-processor integrated in all post-2006 Intel-CPU-based PCs. It has [full network and memory access](https://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html) and runs proprietary, signed, closed-source software at ring -3, independently of the BIOS, main CPU and platform operating system — a fact which many regard as an unacceptable security risk (particularly given that at least one remotely exploitable security hole has already been reported). For Linux check [this](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sakaki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide) or the [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MujjuTWpQJk).


### [Operating System Suggestions](#operating-systems-suggestions)

These are only a handful suggested Distros. I do not intent do list all distros that I think are usable, the list mainly list them because they are well maintained, usable for beginners + experts and they have lots of background, which indicates that they are reliable, secure, private and accepted widely in the privacy and security scene. It is not a bias based list which means other distros that are not directly mentioned are maybe even better or similar like the ones I choose to list. Do not bash other Distros because of my findings, keep the piece, thanks.

Not so good in terms of privacy:
- [Microsoft Windows](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html), please see [here](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.html) and [here](https://twitter.com/netresec/status/1440036446291693574) to get a small overview.

## [VPN](#vpn)

PrivacyTools, now called PrivacyGuides spreads [misinformation regarding Five Eyes, 9 Eyes, and 14 Eyes](https://www.privacyguides.org/providers/vpn/#criteria) [jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction). Over the years PTIO/PGIO updated their original statement a lot and it looks better today but it is still overall wrong because people tend to believe that they are more secure and private if they use services, tools etc. that are not connected to such countries, programs or cooperation's - in the real world, this is not the case. There is no evidence to backup such claim, it is more likely the opposite, there is evidence that this does not change anything at all as I will explain below in detail with one specific example, there are others but it would be too complex here to go into every single detail because most people are already overwhelmed with this one given example.


Example that criminals in the real-world would use

Assuming you choose a provider outside any of those alliances and countries and their real servers are not located in such countries or have any other [partnership](https://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/fra-2017-surveillance-intelligence-services-vol-2_en.pdf), there is still no guarantee that the provider is not forced by other laws and cooperation to hand over your data anyway. There are alliances which are not directly bound by data protection laws only, lets say you plan to kill someone and you choose to use provider X as assurance that your secret is safe, you really think they not going down on you? With they I mean e.g. [Interpol](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/interpol-arrests-1-000-suspects-seizes-27m-in-crackdown-on-cybercrime), if they not already obtained evidence that you used provider X to plan or spread your plans to kill someone, such thinking is more than naive. Interpol will rain down on you, you can count on that and every country that is not working with one of those alliances works together with eg. [Europol](https://twitter.com/Europol/status/1465277646250680321), Interpol and others. There is no country that does not work together with some organization across borders to hunt down criminals. There is no actual evidence that someone got away while planing and executing murder on the internet, it often took long but at the end everyone made a mistake and the feds got them, see [Silkroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)), even with Tor and other protection mechanism there is always something, human error or other variables. Thinking you are 100% protected and get away with it is [naive](https://netzpolitik.org/2022/gutachten-veroeffentlicht-wie-us-geheimdienste-daten-aus-der-eu-abgreifen-koennten/), it takes time to hunt criminals down, yes but there was no case ever that survived for long, the moment the feds are getting involved you can basically say goodbye, see cases like [Cyberbunker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberBunker), Silk [etc](https://www.caymancompass.com/crime-and-courts/).

[People can also secretly do illegal surveillance](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/this-swiss-tech-exec-is-said-to-have-operated-a-secret-surveillance-operation) and sell such data or give it away for free. Jurisdiction wise it does not hold but if illegal obtained contain hard evidence for e.g. murder, they [will anyway start an investigation](https://gilleslaw.com/illegally-obtained-evidence/) even if they cannot directly prosecute you based on the illegal obtained data. This happened several times, one of the most known example for this is the [Panama Hack](https://www.clearyenforcementwatch.com/2019/01/u-s-criminal-prosecution-based-on-panama-papers-hack-raises-novel-legal-issues/).

--------------------------

If you do [illegal stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_jurisdiction#:~:text=Criminal%20jurisdiction%20is%20a%20term,the%20commission%20of%20a%20crime.&text=People%20must%20be%20tried%20in%20the%20same%20state%20the%20crime%20is%20committed). that is forbidden in every country alias transborder crimes the [jurisdiction argument alone does not matter](https://web.archive.org/web/20210419235515/https://blog.privacytools.io/relisting-startpage/) and even if, they [will bypass](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/01/using-foreign-nationals-to-bypass-us-surveillance-restrictions.html) it because if the judge gets evidence that there is something that you are involved in, they can rule and [force everyone to hand over all data or shut it down](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-vpn-service-used-by-ransomware-gangs-was-just-taken-down-by-police/). This is okay because the Internet shall no place to help, support or advertise criminal activities.

--------------------------

Some more details
- There are multiple types of [jurisdiction in a criminal case](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/jurisdiction-criminal-case.html).
- PrivacyTools or short PTIO, wrongly spread and assume jurisdiction matters when it comes to VPNs or Software in general, yet they fail to list one single precedent case, because there is none. Their believes is based on Snowdens leaked picture - among some other stuff - that got spread around the Internet and misinterpreted - from people that are not experts, aka news media - based on the assumption that Google and Big Tech works directly together with the Govt. to hand over all your data. This is not the case, the Govt. needs to request such cases and explain in detail to court why they want to have such data. In such a case they already gathered enough evidence that you are a criminal. Criminal laws overrule any privacy laws. Google etc. also do not get paid to hand over any data, so why should they if it is huge effort without getting anything in return. It is the opposite, Google wants to collect data because they make the money with it and there is no evidence that they sell obtained data directly to the NSA in order to make money based on your private data. Big Tech wants to collect data to build their own algorithm, tools which they can sell, they have absolute zero interest in selling stuff which benefits themselves to feed their programs, algorithm and to gain intelligence to stay on top of the competition. If you sell and share all your data to the competition you can close your business.
- Encryption is what matters more than jurisdiction because if they - for example ISP - cannot use such data to connect the dots to you because missing metadata, no one can build a case against you and the court will automatically reject any attempt to prosecute you. You only get prosecuted if there is enough evidence which can include metadata. The Intelligent Agencies around the world request data if they have reasons to believe that your service is involved into illegal activities, this is absolute not bound to the UK, USA etc. only, such data request are common. The only difference is mass surveillance vs individual requests. However the [original surveillance program got now stopped](https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance/nsa-surveillance) and [declared as illegal](https://www.dw.com/en/nsa-snowden/a-54797779). There are no new programs and you cannot just secretly establish new programs without money and funds for such surveillance. However, there are other projects and programs started or still [running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects), keep in mind that the list is incomplete and some countries might never - in public - disclosed their programs.
- There is no case in which jurisdiction makes a difference. If Swiss, that have the strongest privacy laws in the world have evidence enough that you are a indeed a criminal they still can order a Swiss ISP to hand over data, there are dozens of such cases across every country, no matter if Five eyes or not. She [here](https://ipkitten.blogspot.com/2018/04/swedish-patents-and-market-court-of.html), [here](https://torrentfreak.com/isp-ordered-to-hand-over-pirates-details-after-cracked-software-phoned-home-200629/) or read the [book](https://books.google.de/books?id=KNUy5a3ssykC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=swiss+isp+ordered+to+hand+over+data&ots=4G6pSB40vm&sig=ACfU3U1blBLXNWcizc3exBqSQbl4NuYfEA&hl=en).
- Jurisdiction can makes things harder but [not impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement#Controversy) in case we are referring to - hand over data - to X. There is no evidence that none members cannot simply request data too. Leaks only showed included members but never ever mentioned what if someone outside those countries try to request data, it is called [special relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Relationship).
- [Collective intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence) is not bound to individual partners or countries.
- Jurisdiction only matters in case there are sufficient information, leaks, metadata available against you or someone else to build a case. The location does not matter if data are sufficient encrypted. The assumption to lower the risk by choosing a country outside the [UKUSA Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement#:~:text=The%20%22Fourteen%20Eyes%22%2C%20consisting,signals%20intelligence%20among%20its%20members) is not proven to make anything more secure, because - depending on the HOPS - the traffic still goes over at least one or more Internet [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)) from one of those countries anyway which then can [collect the traffic and decrypt it later](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1020/001/). Once you gathered such data you can build surveillance strategies, the jurisdiction here simply can be bypassed, illegal obtained or not because they - govt, isp - etc. already got plausible cause to wiretap you. Which happened a lot already in lots of FBI cases. PTIO fails to provide any evidence for their claim how jurisdiction loopholes would change something in your favors.
- None of the PTIO maintainers are experts in internet law, cryptography, security nor are they involved into such cases before or after the Snowden leaks. They basically claim a lot without showing actual evidence. They wrongly interpret pictures from leaks, how they see it, and not based on what is really happening in the real world. This is why no one can take this organization serious. It is a collective of red-pilled people and that is all, in the real world we provide evidence, ask lawyers and check actual laws, doing the needed research and just claiming X without evidence is unprofessional.
- Countries like USA or powerful organisations like NSA do not gave any shit about legal or illegal, so what you think other countries will do, well similar things, it depends who is in charge and who gives the money for such surveillance programs, some countries have simply less budget for surveillance. But that does not mean there is none.
- [Redirecting internet traffic](https://www.securityweek.com/russian-telco-hijacked-internet-traffic-major-networks-accident-or-malicious-action#:~:text=Home%20%E2%80%BA%20Network%20Security-,Russian%20Telco%20Hijacked%20Internet%20Traffic,Networks%20%2D%20Accident%20or%20Malicious%20Action%3F&text=A%20huge%20BGP%20hijack%20by,Russian%20servers%20on%20April%201) is possible and it happened multiple times, this includes every traffic.


Nutshell
- Encryption is what is more important because even if someone is, for whatever reasons, forced to hand over data and the service or programs you used, uses a strong encryption, no one will be able to open and access your private data stream or files. [Zero-knowledge proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) is what ultimate counts in such examples cases, nothing else.
- People tend to want full anonymity and not a VPN. A VPN also leaves traces and metadata behind. It is just harder to backtrack.
- [Coffee shops and airports are not how you get hacked](https://twitter.com/boblord/status/1489632248382967810), there are rare exceptions but this is an generalization VPN providers use or abuse as selling argument. Assuming there is a breach, the shop owner or airport would fix it afterwards anyway to prevent that this will ever happen again because it brings negative light on the IT admins behind. Coming to the false conclusion that every public network is automatically be compromised is a claim without any evidence. The overall web-security evolved in the past years and Browsers, OS getting better and usually respond to threats. The underlying problems are usually at user end or because of bad security practices from the people who setup the networks in the first place.
- [PTIO often spread misinformation](https://lemmy.ml/post/31433) because they are based.

### [About WireGuard](#about-wireguard)

[WireGuard](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/is-wireguard-the-future-of-vpn-protocols-safety-update/). has [many](https://lwn.net/Articles/802376/), [many](https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/wireguard/) [issues](https://tailscale.com/blog/why-not-why-not-wireguard/), as explained [here](https://blog.ipfire.org/post/why-not-wireguard) and [here](https://protonvpn.com/blog/openvpn-vs-wireguard/). Because of [several flaws](https://www.servethehome.com/pfsense-and-freebsd-pull-back-on-kernel-wireguard-support/) WireGuard does not get my approval at this point, their [design goals](https://lore.kernel.org/wireguard/CADdae-ifP9GN=oaKz_SnzDK+uAx7MFHaSkFPymBRgC9t07hY8g@mail.gmail.com/T/) also do not match with what most people, in the real world really want.


- The official app does not have a kill-switch option within the GUI, there is a cmd-line parameter for Linux user but it is overall hard to work with it and there is no guarantee it really works unless you debug it via console or third-party tools to ensure nothing drops.
- The official app has absolute no indicators if you are still connected to the VPN server or not, there is no warning or info indicator when you drop the connection once you minimized the app. You only see connected or disconnected from within the app.
- [WireGuard](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/17380) does [not](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/21692) work with [LLv6](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/17380#issuecomment-1008323004) by design, see [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291#section-2.1).
- VPN provider like eg. ProtonVPN re-wrote lots of the server and client parts, adopted and fixed flaws in their own client app which makes it not really comparable with the original WireGuard app or other VPN provider apps who did similar stuff to fix flaws.
- [Cryptographic proof is not absolute](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02100345).
- WireGuard doesn't dynamically assign IP addresses which means every time you use it, you get the same, easy-to-track static IP address. This overall means WireGuard must log and store your IP address and timestamps. Both OpenVPN and IKEv2 avoid these security concerns by dynamically assigning IP addresses.
- Most RouterOS do not support WireGuard - yet. There are only externals like OpenWRT that support it directly, most users do not installing third-party firmware on their device because it requires technical skill, time and effort - assuming your IoT device is even supported and fully compatible.

Overall except the smaller codebase, less battery draining among the less CPU power you need there is absolute no benefit over OpenVPN.

The main reason why some VPN provider adding it is not security, or privacy, it is in most cases [speed and efficiency](https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/08/wireguard_linux/) compared to IPSec and OpenVPN.

## [Tor](#tor)

**This section is not finished.**

- [Tor is not perfect](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7gd9b/facebook-helped-fbi-hack-child-predator-buster-hernandez) same like any other protocol it has weaknesses but depending on how you count far less than most other known protocols. This argument makes it worth alone to suggest using the tor network.
- JavaScript among some other old and outdated web-standard are among the highest threat to the tor network, this is not really a tor network issue because tor simply need to fallback to older standards to not entirely breaking the web as we know it.
- Tor does not encrypted inbound traffic, for this you would need I2P. You can use I2P together with Tor but it is more configuration trouble.
- Content is encrypted between client and nodes but not from exit relay to server. The anonymity relies on servers, the more servers the more anonymous the user is because he can easily hide in the mass. However, if someone compromise [hundreds of Tor Relays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvBAaUPzvBQ) the entire privacy aspect will be lowered or even compromised.
- HTTPS redirects can be blocked so Tor isn't a fail-safe alternative.
- Using a browser add-on that rewrites the URL request before it's sends a GET request is paramount to security. If relying on the initial request to redirect after the fact the resulting method could be overwritten by an exploited endpoint.
- Combining Invisible Internet Project alias I2P and Freenet for file-sharing could help solve some, but not all problems.
- The biggest problem with Tor is that it is not really usable in the real world due to how it works, most websites simply ban Tor traffic, or you get spammed with CAPTCHAs. Some ISPs directly flag you if you use the tor network which means you are classified as possible threat which makes you more unique among - normal - users.


Major problems while using Tor
- Constantly reCaptcha requests, which you need to solve. Almost every captcha system is at some point privacy invasive by design.
- Lots of providers throttle your internet connection once they detect, unusual, traffic. This can make you more likely a target because you stick out like a needle from the mass.
- Security pages, like banking often entirely block connections coming from Tor users which makes it impossible to use Tor on eg. your banking page. Trying to workaround this often results in more fingerprinting and restrictions.



Tools
- [Arti](https://blog.torproject.org/arti_004_released/) – Tor's project to create a working embeddable Tor client in Rust.
- [Nipe](https://github.com/GouveaHeitor/nipe) – Nipe is a script to make Tor Network your default gateway.
- [BlackBelt WASTE - ipv4 / Tor / i2p + AI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blackbeltwaste/) – Download and create your own WASTE networks, to e.g. create a secure forum.


## [HTTPS](#https)

**This section is not finished.**

- HTTPS wrongly gets advertised as secure, which is not the case, there are bunch of scenarios in which HTTPS fails to protect the users. Self-hosting won't solve much because even self-hosted setup would have to talk to the outside world in the end.
- [Proxies like Squid](https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/HTTPS) can do HTTPS intercepting. Certificate transparency effectively solves this because certain browsers, currently only Safari and Chrome [require all new certificates be submitted to multiple certificate transparency lists](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/net/docs/certificate-transparency.md) - if it encounters a certificate that isn't, it’ll show a warning page before establishing the TLS session. This doesn’t stop interception at all, but the first time it happens that some huge website notices a certificate they didn’t authorize and/or should be blocked by their CAA records, it’ll be a large event with disastrous consequences for the CA, likely triggering immediate within under <48 hours removal from publicly trusted CA lists. This happened already, [see here](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kazakhstan-government-is-intercepting-https-traffic-in-its-capital/).
- [Countries could ban HTTPS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/russia-wants-to-ban-the-use-of-secure-protocols-such-as-tls-1-3-doh-dot-esni/).
- Tor network helps against many vulnerabilities HTTPS has. With Tor, every domain generates their own public/private key pair (which represents the domain itself) hence making it impractical for actors to break all of them (in fact, breaking even one of the 128-bit ed25519 keys would be a breakthrough in cryptography).

## [Guides connected to privacy, security or anonymity](#guides-connected-to-privacy-security-or-anonymity)

Please keep in mind that some guides might be a bit older, however some still have meaning and you possible can learn from them in an historic context to see how certain stuff evolved, or stay the same. In general guidance are only as good as the author did the research on the given topic, which means that some things can be universally applied to specific threads and other guidance are specific to one or a few given examples.


I usually only unlist stuff that is entirely incorrect or even dangerous to follow because security practical constantly evolves in both ways, positive ways and negative ways, which means new attacks emerge and new counter measurements also getting released because of the new threats.


Provided guidance are provided as-is.

## [Versions Control](#versions-control)

Remember that just because you self-host doesn't mean you can ignore DMCA take-down requests (DMCA itself is obviously an US law, but many [Western](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32001L0029) [countries have similar laws](https://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_id=16)). You can choose to ignore such DMCA requests if they decide to send one to your self-hosted website, but not honoring it means you think you're not infringing on their copyright and are willing to go to court over it. If they don't want to go this far, or you try to not include contact info, they'll probably first send a DMCA to your web host/registrar who will suspend your hosting/website unless you counter-notice, which still means you've got to be ready to fight a lawsuit. Note that Cloudflare forwards DMCA requests to your web host company, so you can't hide behind CF.

![Image credit: devrant + RMS himself](https://img.devrant.com/devrant/rant/r_1195970_gW3o6.jpg)

I will not add the following projects/software and I will not debate this. Don't make [him](https://stallman.org/) cry again 😢.

Please keep in mind that every software and service is at some point fixable and just because they are listed under this section does not mean they cannot be relisted once the mentioned product fixed provided criticism.


- [5G Bio Shield](https://5gbioshield.com/) – Cash gab to tool people with nonsense and claims + promises they cannot hold.
- [American Civil Liberties Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) – ACLU unlisted because they might support and defend [Nazis](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/onion_acludefends.html). There is one reference link in my guide but I reviewed it, so I only let this one link stand but I clearly say you should not support such ideology or support right-winged people.
- [Aether](https://getaether.net/) – Peer-to-peer ephemeral public communities. The repository has not been updated with code since May 2020. The last version 0.15 has been released in November 2020 and there is no mention of it in the repository.
- [Apple’s “Share Focus” is an uncharacteristically disastrous invasion of privacy](https://old.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/r7e9pk/share_focus_is_an_uncharacteristically_disastrous/)
- [Big Blue Button](https://bigbluebutton.org) – A professional video conferencing tool focused on online teaching and presenting. As such, it provides special features like slide-sharing, private and group chat, emoji feedback, polls, breakout rooms and many more. Removed due to [privacy concerns](https://empri-devops.de/blog/2022/01/26/bbb-learning-dashboard/).

- [Briar](https://briarproject.org/) – Peer-to-peer encrypted messaging and forums. You can find an unofficial list with forums [here](https://codeberg.org/PandaCoderPL/Briar-Forums). [Briar itself does not provide anonymity](https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar/-/wikis/FAQ#does-briar-provide-anonymity) – Allows encrypted messages over Tor, WiFi, or Bluetooth (threat model is a communications-hostile environment/government). Briar gets unlisted compared to other alternatives because you need to be invited by other strangers - or friends - to join groups which makes it hard for beginners to find new groups, so it overall makes things harder to use as daily messenger. You can also not inspect the invite links or preview rooms, you just need to blindly trust people giving you a link. The program itself is perfectly fine but I ONLY suggest using it if you are on a demonstration, for other purposes other systems are more sufficient.

- [Dot Browser](https://dothq.co) – The browser with privacy at heart. Based on Firefox with some additions, modifications. The reason it does not get listed is that there are rarely updates which is controversial enough when it comes to overall security, if you want to use it you basically need to install nightly builds.

The developer has [no clue how Kasperskys AV really works](https://freenode.logbot.info/grapheneos/20210607) and such people dare to talk about security.

You can find a list of public home servers over [here](https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html). Matrix is [questionable](https://lemmy.ml/post/134488). Group calls via VOIP have [no authentication](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/13074) currently, meaning that non room participants can also join the calls. We recommend that you do not use this feature for the time being.
    - [Cinny](https://zulip.com/) – Imagine a Matrix client where you can enjoy the conversation using simple, elegant and secure interface protected by e2ee with the power of open source.
    - [Commune Chat](https://commune.chat/) – Commune unifies chat, email and forums into one powerful tool.
    - [Element](https://element.io/) – All-in-one secure chat app for teams, friends and organizations. Keeps conversations in your control, safe from data-mining and ads. [End-to-end encryption](https://blog.cryptoaustralia.org.au/2017/03/21/run-your-end-to-end-encrypted-chat-server-matrix-riot/). A list of official clients can be found [here](https://matrix.org/clients/). Profile pictures, reactions, and nicknames are not encrypted this among the fact that encryption is by default enabled for everything is the main reason why I do not list it.
    - [Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) – Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.
    - [Privacy research on Matrix.org](https://gitlab.com/libremonde-org/papers/research/privacy-matrix.org) – Small research project on Matrix.org. - **controversial**

    - [gomuks](https://maunium.net/go/gomuks) – A terminal based Matrix client written in Go.
    - [syphon](https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon) – A privacy focused Matrix client, not often updated and slower than e.g. FluffyChat.
    - [The Grid protocol](https://github.com/thegridprotocol/home) – The Grid is a Push-Native, Federated and Decentralized Event bus designed around privacy (EU GDPR) and self-hosting. It is an alternative protocol to Matrix. - **controversial**
    - [weechat-matrix](https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix) – Weechat Matrix protocol script written in Python.
- [WindowsFX](https://www.windowsfx.org/) – Still contains telemetry which makes it not worth to install, since you can tweak stock OS.
- [RTranslator](https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator) - Universal translator based on Google's APIs and Bluetooth LE. It connects to Google endpoints.
- VSCode nor the [Web Version](https://vscode.dev/), the Browser Version due to enabled [Telemetry](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry) by default, same like the crash reporter, you need to disable it, restart the app or block it via ad-blocker. Their [marketplace is also known to be vulnerable](https://snyk.io/blog/vulnerable-visual-studio-code-extensions-marketplace/).
- [Sayches](https://sayches.com/) – [Sayches](https://github.com/Sayches) is a micro-blogging social media platform for ephemeral content giving its users the freedom of expression without the fear of repercussion. Weird claims against Mastodon and other social networks + beta + unprofessional claims.
- [Session - Private Messenger](https://getsession.org/) – Extreme focus on privacy based on [Blockchain technology](https://cointelegraph.com/news/homeland-security-to-use-blockchain-in-tracking-goods-people-globally). Session is a much more complicated protocol with way too many additions and differing specs for it to be able to interoperate with Signal at this point. Possible [#fedpot](https://nitter.net/WPalant/status/1281540005190672384) and a gulag for nazis and [alt-right scene](https://nitter.net/WPalant/status/1281578526932705281) in general. - **highly controversial**

- [Signal](https://signal.org/) – Claims to be extreme [focused on privacy](https://signal.org/bigbrother/santaclara/), combined with some extra features like voice calls. Strong encryption by design. [Why Signal don't add option to create an account without phone number?](https://freedom.press/training/blog/beyond-signal-phone-numbers/) – They claim to be working on a proper way to support this, [Signal itself relies on Azure, AWS & Co.](https://www.reddit.com/r/signal/comments/hd2z9p/where%5C_are%5C_signals%5C_servers%5C_physically%5C_located/), which creates multiple [problems](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/02/signal-could-get-kicked-out-of-amazon-web-services/). I still list it here because [metadata](https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/apple-now-relies-on-google-cloud-platform-and-amazon-s3-for-icloud-data/) are encrypted and minimal. [Signal to add closed-source spam detection](https://www.signal.org/blog/keeping-spam-off-signal/).

- [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/) – A privacy oriented search engine made in France with no tracking. - *[controversial](https://codeberg.org/swiso/website/issues/138) same like [DuckDuckGo](https://lulz.com/community/thread/social-experiment-duckduckgo-hiring-racial-discrimination/)*

## [Alt-right communities, they are by no means alternatives for anything](#alt-right-communities-they-are-by-no-means-alternatives-for-anything)

My guide got copied already dozen of times without any credit, re-published on alt-right platforms [such as 4Chan](https://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/84302113). I do not allow anonymous and random troll accounts to use or link my guides without permission nor consent because I do not want that Nazis abuse my findings to harass, bully and dox others or to spread their propaganda. 4chan is the dirt the internet does not need, and this is not [even news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan).

I never gave my permission to link or copy parts of my guidance on such websites because my intention is to help honest people who mean well and not people who abuse my findings and stuff for their questionable purposes.


Do not bother nor give those platforms any clicks or attention. Mostly [filled with alt-right people and extremists](https://www.splcenter.org/peril-guide-online-youth-radicalization/). Some of listed projects are down for good. I do not link the evidence but ~~Google~~ searching and checking who is behind those platforms clearly shows that they are mostly alt-right winged, often used by people who got banned on legitimate social media platforms.
